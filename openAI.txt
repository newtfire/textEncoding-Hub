Walking down the street, my nose leads the way
The aroma of Chinese food, it beckons me to stay
Egg rolls sizzling, dumplings steaming hot
I can't resist, I gotta give it a shot

Chinese food, Chinese food
So flavorful, so diverse
From sweet and sour to spicy hot
My taste buds are on a curse

So many options, I don't know what to do
Vegetables stir-fried, meats so tender and juicy

So delicious, it's an addiction
I'll have it for lunch, dinner, and even breakfast too

You'll find a Chinese restaurant around
From takeout to sit-down
The options are bountiful and profound
Outro:

I'll eat it every day
So flavorful and satisfying
I'll never get enough, I'll always say.
