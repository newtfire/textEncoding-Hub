# Norton Teyoninhokarawen XML Encoding Exercises 

This series of assignments is part of our classâ€™s collaboration with the Digital
John Norton team at University of Guelph. You will be working with a
photo facsimile of a manuscript letter and a transcription prepared in Microsoft Word by
the Guelph team. 

**Workflow suggestion**: This series involves studying the handwritten manuscripts
and comparing them with the transcriptions in Word. Tips: 
* You could try to split your screen so the
code editor is open for one half of it. 
* I think it helps to do this using
two different screens if you can rig this. For example, you could log in to a machine in a campus computer lab,
clone the textEncoding-Hub and open the photofacsimile page on a big monitor to look at
while you do your coding on a different machine. (You can be logged in to two computers in a lab at the same time.) 

## Exercise 1
Choose one of the following letters to work with, taking a look at both the text
and the transcription that we have available. Your task is to create an XML document that
represents as much as possible what you can see/understand from the manuscript photo facsimiles.


* **Option A**: Pages 1 and 2 of a long letter written on March 9, 1804
     * [Photo facsimiles](Class-Examples/Norton-Project/A_1804-03-09_pages1-2.pdf) **Heads up!** There is some challenging "cross writing"
     where Norton wrote another paragraph later over top of the first page, and this is 
     not covered in the transcription that we have.
     * [Transcription in Word](Class-Examples/Norton-Project/A_1804-03-09_pages1-2_WordTranscript.docx)
     * EXTRA: Here's [another photofacsimile including rest of the super-long letter](A_1804-03-09_completeLetter), in case you are curious or want to figure
     out where the extra portion on our page 1 is coming from.
    
* **Option B**: The last 2 pages of the same long letter in option A
     * [Photo facsimiles](Class-Examples/Norton-Project/B_1804-03-09_NortonLetter.pdf)
     * [Transcription in Word](Class-Examples/Norton-Project/B_1804-03-09_NL_WordTranscript.docx) 
     
* **Option C**: Letter written on April 25, 1804
     * [Photo facsimiles](Class-Examples/Norton-Project/1804-04-25_NortonLetterPassage.pdf)
     * [Transcription in Word](Class-Examples/Norton-Project/1804-04-25_NLP_Transcript.docx)
     
### How to do this assignment
Take this in stages: 
* You can start your XML code by copying in the transcription, but take your time
and read the text slowly comparing it with what you see in the photos. 
* Develop your
markup to encode the structure of the document, the meaningful information about the structure of the letter
(the paragraphs, and if you have it, a dateline showing when and where Norton was writing, and 
the parts where he signs off and closes the letter). 
* Try marking information like places, people, interesting objects (etc.) What seems
interesting to track with markup?
* Here's the challenge: Find things that you can see in the manuscript but are not represented 
in the transcription. There will be a lot of this: you may not be able to read some of it, but try to
find a way to represent these *textual events*  (like deletions and insertions) in your markup.

This is an introductory assignment and you do not have time to perfectly mark everything! 
Just try to capture something of what you can see, and submit it before class so we can discuss how you approached
the markup! The goal here is to come up with a *system* for marking up what you see in the photofacsimiles more than totally completing the work!
