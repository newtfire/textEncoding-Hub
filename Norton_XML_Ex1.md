# Norton Teyoninhokarawen XML Encoding Exercises 

This series of assignments is part of our classâ€™s collaboration with the Digital
John Norton team at University of Guelph. You will be working with a
photo facsimile of a manuscript letter and a transcription prepared in Microsoft Word by
the Guelph team. 

**Workflow suggestion**: This series involves studying the handwritten manuscripts
and comparing them with the transcriptions in Word. I think it helps to do this using
two screens if you can! You could log in to a machine in a campus computer lab,
clone the textEncoding-Hub and open the photofacsimile page on a big monitor to look at
while you do your coding on a different machine. Or try to split your screen so the
code editor is open for one half of it. 

## Exercise 1
Choose one of the following letters to work with, taking a look at both the text
and the transcription that we have available. 

* **Option A**: Pages 1 and 2 of a long letter
     * [Photo facsimiles](Norton-Project/A_1804-03-09_pages1-2.pdf) **Heads up!** There is some challenging "cross writing"
     where Norton wrote another paragraph later over top of the first page, and this is 
     not covered in the transcription that we have.
     * [Word document transcription](A_1804-03-09_pages1-2_WordTranscript.docx)
     * EXTRA: Here's [another photofacsimile including rest of the super-long letter](A_1804-03-09_completeLetter), in case you are curious or want to figure
     out where the extra portion on our page 1 is coming from.
