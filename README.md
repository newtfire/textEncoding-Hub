Welcome to the textEncoding-Hub! This is a repository to help introduce and orient DIGIT students to the GitHub collaboration environment, and accompanies the course website posted at <https://newtfire.org/courses/textEncoding/>

In order for you to participate fully in this shared class space, I need to add you as a collaborator. [Set up your own GitHub account](https://github.com) and write to me to tell me how to find you.

Now that you're here, as soon as you're ready, you should try to "clone" this repository on your local computer.
