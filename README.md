# textEncoding-Hub

Welcome to the textEncoding-Hub! This is a repository to help introduce and orient DIGIT students to the GitHub collaboration environment, and accompanies the course website posted at <https://newtfire.org/courses/textEncoding/>

In order for you to participate fully in this shared class space, I need to add you as a collaborator. [Set up your own GitHub account](https://github.com) and write to me to tell me how to find you.

Now that you're here, you should try to "clone" this repository on your local computer.

Here is a quick and handy list of git commands: <https://github.com/newtfire/textEncoding-Hub/blob/master/GitCommands.md>
You can read our detailed guide to get started with Git (or just use this as we do, like a reference to search in for information): <https://newtfire.org/courses/tutorials/explainGitShell.html>

There are things we will do together only in the remote webpage view of GitHub visible at <https://github.com/newtfire/textAnalysis-Hub/>:
*  See if you can find the "Issues" area by mousing over the icons on the top (in the new view) or the right-hand (old view) side of the GitHub page: "Issues" is the exclamation point inside the circle. We're using the "Issues" page to open conversations about questions, problems, things we need to discuss and fix and work on together. 

* If we formulate a new method or policy we definitely want to follow, we'll post a Wiki page about it. (Find the Wiki area, the icon that looks like a book.) The Issues and Wikis are searchable, and you write in them using markdown syntax, which lets you easily and quickly format headings, lists, bold, italics, or share an image.
