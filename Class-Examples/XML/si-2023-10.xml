                     analyzes the narrative conventions of women’s biographies in documentary social
                     networks, focusing on sample collections of types of personae. In 2015-2016,

                  <note>Lisa M. Wilson is Professor in the Department of English and Communication at SUNY Potsdam, where she has taught since 2005. Her areas of interest include transatlantic Romantic and Victorian era literature, particularly women’s  writing and popular forms such as the Gothic novel and the literary ballad. She is also interested in book history and bibliographical studies, particularly in the study of authorship in the long nineteenth century (1780-1900). She has published in <title level="j">European Romantic Review</title>, <title level="j">Romanticism on the Net</title> (now <title level="j">RaVon</title>), <title level="j">Romantic Circles</title>, <title level="j">Romantic Textualities</title>, and elsewhere. She is currently working on a monograph on Romantic-period authorship and literary celebrity. Her work on Digital Mitford thus far includes editing and coding Mitford’s <title level="a">Introduction</title> to her collected <title level="m">Dramatic Works</title> (1854), a critical memoir that recounts the author’s influences and experiences at Covent Garden and Drury Lane in the 1820s and 30s. It also includes researching Mitford’s publication history for the site’s working bibliography, particularly tracking the migration of Mitford’s stories from their first publication to their later reappearances in collections and periodicals. A Founding Editor of Digital Mitford, she and her teams of student research assistants have been at work since 2013 on transcribing, coding, and researching Mitford’s letters from 1819 to the early 1820s and on Mitford’s early poems, including her 22 sonnets and her long poem, <title level="m">Weston Grove</title>. She is currently teaching a course on digital textual editing for junior and senior undergraduates and directing undergraduate students internships for Digital Mitford.

                  <note resp="#ebb #lmw">A lifelong friend of <persName ref="#MRM">Mary Russell Mitford</persName>
                        who knew her from their childhood in the 1790s, Harness launched the first
                        major effort to collect and edit Mitford’s letters into a series of volumes,
                        which was completed by his assistant, <persName ref="#Lestrange">Alfred Guy
                           Kingan L’Estrange</persName> a year after Harness’s death, and published
                        as <title ref="#Lestrange_Letters">The Life of Mary Russell Mitford, Related
                           in a Selection from her Letters to her Friends</title>. This collection
                        was originally intended to be six volumes, but was cut back to three by the
                        publishers, to Harness’s distress. Harness and <persName ref="#Byron">Byron</persName> were also friends from
                        their schooling at Harrow, as Byron sympathized with Harness’s experience of
                        a disabled foot, crushed in an accident in early childhood. Byron considered
                        dedicating <bibl>the first two cantos of <title level="m">Childe Harold’s
                           Pilgrimage</title>
                     </bibl> to Harness, but refrained so as not to taint Harness’s reputation as
                        he was taking orders as an Anglican curate. Harness admired and encouraged
                        Mitford’s playwrighting in particular, and she commented that he was one of
                        the few of her friends who thought she should prioritize the drama over
                        prose. When <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">William Macready</persName> was
                        attacked in <bibl corresp="#Stage">an anonymous Blackwood’s Magazine piece
                           in 1825</bibl> for his demands and rudeness to Mitford over revisions to
                        <title ref="#Rienzi">Rienzi</title>, Macready assumed that Harness was
                        the author of the anonymous piece, though in <date when="1839">1839</date>
                        after many years of distance, Harness assured Macready in person that he was
                        not the writer, though he may have shared word of the poor treatment his
                        friend had endured. William Harness was the son of John
                        Harness, M.D. and Sarah Dredge; he was baptized at Whitchurch, Hampshire on
                        April 13, 1790. He received his B.A. in 1812 and his M.A. in 1816 from
                        Christ’s College, Cambridge. He served as curate at Kelmeston, Hampshire
                        (1812) and Dorking (1814-1816). He was preacher at Trinity Chapel, Conduit
                        Street, London and minister and lecturer at St. Anne’s in Soho. He was Boyle
                        lecturer in London (1822) and was curate at Hampstead from 1828 to 1844. In
                        1825, he published an eight-volume edition of Shakespeare, including a
                        biography; his friends would later endow a prize in his name at Cambridge
                        for the study of Shakespearean literature. He also authored numerous essays
                        and reviews, some for the <title ref="#QuarterlyRev_per">Quarterly Review</title>. From 1844 to 1847 he was
                        minister of Brompton Chapel in London. He undertook to raise the funds to
                        build the church of All Saints, Knightsbridge, in the parish of St.
                        Margaret’s Westminster, which opened in 1849, and he then became perpetual curate of
                        that congregation. At the 1851 and 1861 censuses, he lived at 3 Hyde Park
                        Terrace, Westminster St. Margaret, Middlesex, with his sister <persName ref="#Harness_Mary">Mary Harness</persName>
                        and his first cousin <persName>Jemima Harness</persName>, daughter of his uncle William. He died
                        while on a visit to one of his former curates in
                        Battle, Sussex. At the time of his death he living at the same address at 3
                        Hyde Park Terrace; he is buried in Bath.Sources: <bibl>

The reforms included: 1)universal manhood suffrage for those age 21 and above, thus eliminating the property ownership requirement for male voters, 2)vote by secret ballot, thus eliminating the publication of votes 3)elimination of the property requirement for Members of Parliament, 4)payment for service as a Member of Parliament, thus making office-holding financially feasible for those without independent incomes, 5)redrawing constituency boundaries to ensure that each M.P. represented the same number of voters, thereby equalizing constituencies and eliminating so-called rotten boroughs, and 5)annual parliamentary elections, aimed at decreasing the practice of bribing or intimidating voters.</note>

Puritans were not a single religious sect with a unified theological or political viewpoint. In the early 17th century, they allied themselves with Scottish Presbyterians and with English parliament members who opposed the royal perogative. They came to power after the first English Civil War and the majority of Puritan clergy left the Church of England after the Restoration to practice as nonconformists/dissenters.</note>

George was the younger son of merchant William Adams (1752-1811), MP for Plympton Erle (1796-1801) and for Totnes (1801-1811), and Mary Chadder. He was the younger brother of William Dacres Adams (1775-1862), who became Private Secretary to two Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom: Pitt the Younger (1804–1806) and the Duke of Portland (1807-1809). William Dacres Adams inherited the estate of Bowden in the parish of Ashprington, near Totnes in Devon, from his father, who had purchased it from the Trist family about 1800; William Dacres Adams allowed George and his family to live there after his own marriage. Bowden House, the Georgian mansion located on the former estate, is currently a grade I listed building. His middle name is variously recorded as Pownoll and Pownall.</note>

The case is very different now; she is still a poker--but a poker of whom every one is afraid. It must be confessed that this silent observation from such an observer is rather formidable. Most writers are good-humoured chatterers--neither very wise nor very witty:—but nine times out of ten (at least in the few that I have known) unaffected and pleasant, and quite removing by their conversation any awe that may have been excited by their works.

In 1621, he was prosecuted for corruption and barred from further public service.

Perhaps the most famous Beaumont and Fletcher play is the ribald comedy <title level="m">The Knight of the Burning Pestle</title>. Beaumont was also a poet and friend of Ben Jonson.

                  <note resp="#lmw #rnes">Bewick is one of the most important practitioners of modern wood engraving. He is the best-known and one of the finest wood engravers employing a technique (which he did not invent) in which hard boxwood is carved on the end-grain using metal-engraver's tools. This technique allows for the creation of finer and more detailed engraved images and also results in an engraving block that is more durable than those carved with the grain. Notable works of literary illustration include editions of <persName ref="#Goldsmith">Oliver Goldsmith</persName>'s <title level="m">The Traveller</title> and <title level="m">The Deserted Village</title>, Thomas Parnell's <title level="m">The Hermit</title>, and William Somervile's <title level="m">The Chase</title>. His major works as a naturalist include <title level="m">A History of British Birds</title> and <title level="m">A General History of Quadrupeds</title>, as well as a series of editions of <title level="m">Aesop's Fables</title>. One of Bewick's specialties was his tail- or tale-pieces, small engraved illustrations used to fill gaps left by page breaks.</note>

                  <note resp="#ncl #lmw">Quaker, abolitionist, radical reformer in politics and religion, and an agricultural experimenter in the cross-breeding of Merino sheep, Birkbeck emigrated to America in 1817 in order to establish a utopian community in the Illinois territory. Author of <title ref="#America_Birkbeck">Notes on a Journey in America</title> and <title ref="#Illinois_Birkbeck">Letters from Illinois</title>. These much-read works, which presented a utopian, anti-clerical, and anti-aristocratic vision of American settlement, were believed to be instrumental in encouraging many disaffected Europeans to emigrate to the American prairies, and set off a pamphlet war about on the topic of American emigration to the so-called English Prairie. (See Eaton, Joseph. The Anglo-American Pamphlet War, 1800-1825. New York:  Palgrave/Macmillan, 2012). He became president of Illinois's first agricultural society, worked against the establishment of slavery in the state, and briefly served as Secretary of State for Illinois. He was acquainted with Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Edward Coles, and Robert Owen, himself the founder of another midwestern utopian community in New Harmony, Indiana.</note>

Although never prominent in the legal profession, he was trained in Scotland and practiced as an advocate, and later also practiced at the English bar. Boswell represented the Scottish bookseller Alexander Donaldson in the important copyright case, Donaldson v.  Beckett. <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName> compares his skill as a biographer unfavorably to that of <persName ref="#Aubrey_John">Aubrey</persName>, preferring the latter's brevity.

                     This poet fought on the Parliamentary side in the English Civil Wars and is best known for his satirical burlesque poem Hudibras, which was published in parts in the 1660s and 1670s. Transparently informed by Cervantes's novel <title ref="#Don_Quixote_novel">Don Quixote</title>, Hudibras features a bickering knight-and-servingman duo and scourges various kinds of hypocrisy. It won Butler the patronage of Charles II, despite the poet's earlier political activity.</note>

Married in 1815, Lady Byron formally separated from her husband almost a year later, shortly after Ada's birth. She had left her marital household with her child, having endured many of Lord Byron's outbursts, taunts, and (it has been rumored) rape. She encouraged her daughter's mathematical pursuits, engaging the celebrity mathematician Augustus de Morgan to instruct her. Late in life, Lady Byron was befriended by an American visitor, <title level="m">Uncle Tom's Cabin</title> author Harriet Beecher Stowe, who, after Lady Byron's death, defended her separation from her husband in <title level="m">Lady Byron Vindicated</title>, for which Stowe was widely condemned.</note>

These events are the subject matter of <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName>'s tragedy <title ref="#CharlesI_MRMplay">Charles the First</title>. The second son of James VI of Scotland, who became James I of England when Charles was three years old, the future king became James's heir in 1612, upon the death of his extremely popular brother Henry, Prince of Wales. As king, he was susceptible to the influence of his father's ambitious favourite George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, until Buckingham's assassination by a disturbed veteran in 1628. Charles quarrelled with Parliament over matters ranging from finances to control of religion and cultural observances. He instituted a disastrous policy of <soCalled>personal rule,</soCalled> and in August 1642, declared war on Parliament. After the Parliamentary faction, with its New Model Army, achieved victory, Charles was tried for treason and, declaring himself <q>the martyr of the people,</q> was executed outside the Banqueting House at Whitehall that had been designed by Inigo Jones for James I. A week after his execution, he was quietly buried at Windsor and the monarchy was abolished. Charles I is the apocryphal author of the <title level="m">Eikon Basilike, or Pourctraiture of his Sacred Majesty in his Solitudes and Sufferings</title> (1649), which was probably written substantially by John Gauden.</note>

                     <p>English Republican military leader, politician, and dictator. The effective protagonist of Mitford’s play<title ref="#CharlesI_MRMplay">Charles the First</title>. A descendant of the Tudor politician Thomas Cromwell, raised in the Cambridgeshire Fens and educated at Cambridge University, he became deeply spiritual in the 1620s, identifying as a Puritan. (He never called himself a Roundhead, and resisted others' use of this Royalist slur.) He became an M.P. and, in 1641, attacked what he considered <q>ecclesiastical tyranny and usurpation.</q> During the <rs type="event" ref="#EngCivilWar">Civil Wars</rs>, he commanded Parliamentary forces as Lieutenant-General, second only to Sir Thomas, Lord Fairfax, who served as the Parliamentary army's General. Cromwell quickly overshadowed Fairfax and devised the <orgName ref="#New_Model_Army">New Model Army</orgName> (founded 1645).</p>
                     <p>After the <persName ref="#ChasI">king</persName>'s capture and extradition from the Isle of Wight, Cromwell seemed not committed to the notion of trying and executing the king until the eleventh hour, but ultimately served as a Commissioner at the trial and signed the warrant. In the aftermath of the King's execution, Ireland (which had rebelled in 1641) developed a Royalist resistance, which Cromwell and his son-in-law <persName ref="#Ireton">Henry Ireton</persName> suppressed between 1649 and 1651. This war resulted in genocide which killed (through violence, displacement, or disease) up to one third of the Irish population; the exact number of casualties and the time-extent of the period are still debated by historians. The period came to be called An Mallact Cromail (The Curse of Cromwell). In Commonwealth England, Cromwell chaired the Republic's Council of State, then, 1653 until his death in 1658, served as Lord Protector, essentially converting the Republic to a dictatorship and alienating many former supporters. After Cromwell's death and the abdication of the second Lord Protector, his son Richard Cromwell, the Republican experiment ended with Parliament inviting <persName ref="#ChasII">Charles I's son</persName> to return from exile to be restored as king. Throughout the nineteenth century, Cromwell's reputation was on an upswing. The trend was towards viewing him as a man guided by devout faith in God, a desire to provide for his country, and a desire to purify the Protestantism in his country.</p>

                     <p>An exceptionally well-educated and self-assured early modern woman whose literary achievements are extremely significant. Her works include the first complete English translation of Lucretius's controversial Epicurean poem <title level="m">De Rerum Natura</title> (in ms. only until 2012), the epic poem <title level="m">Order and Disorder</title>, which has been read as a proto-feminist take on Genesis that invites comparison with her contemporary <title ref="#ParadiseLost">John Milton's Paradise Lost</title>, and her <title ref="#Memoirs_of_the_life_of_Colonel_Hutchinson">Memoirs of the Life of Colonel John Hutchinson</title>, a biography of her husband that brings to life the drama of the <rs type="event" ref="#EngCivilWar">Civil Wars</rs> and the idealism of the Puritans, particularly for religious liberty and republican government. This work, published in 1806, is the only Lucy Hutchinson composition that was known as such during <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName>'s lifetime.</p>
                     <p>Born Lucy Apsley, the daughter of Sir Allen Apsley, Lieutenant of the Tower of London. In 1638 she fell mutually in love with and married Sir John Hutchinson. While he fought on the <orgName ref="#Parliamentarians">Parliamentarian side</orgName> in the <rs type="event" ref="#EngCivilWar">English Civil Wars</rs>, she provided material assistance, at one point contriving for her brother-in-law (Hutchinson's brother) to pose as him while the real Colonel Hutchinson escaped arrest by the Royalists. At the <rs type="event" ref="#Restoration">Restoration</rs>, she may have saved his life by forging an apologetic letter that he might have been more reticent to write.</p>
                     <p>As the critic <persName>Devoney Looser</persName> has shown, Lucy Hutchinson became an extremely well-known figure during the nineteenth century, featuring as a heroine in many works of fiction and drama.</p>

She became Dauphine of France in 1770 at the age of 14, upon her marriage to Louis-Auguste of France. She became Queen of France and Navarre when Louis-Auguste ascended the throne of France; they had four children. In 1791, during the French Revolution, her title was changed to Queen of the French. She was guillotined in 1793 for treason against France and was buried in an unmarked grave; her body and that of her husband were exhumed during the Bourbon Restoration and reburied at the Basilica of St. Denis.</note>

In 1795, she was allowed to leave Paris for exile in Vienna in a diplomatic exchange, and she later moved with the French royal family to Great Britain. She returned to France in the Bourbon Restoration and became, very briefly, Queen Consort of France, between her uncle Charles X's and her husband Louis XIX's abdications on 2 August 1830. In 1830, she went again into exile in Great Britain and then in Prague.

The family name is sometimes recorded as <q>Midford</q>. Immediate family called him by nicknames including <q>Drum</q>, <q>Tod</q>, and <q>Dodo</q>. He was a member of a minor branch of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle in Northumberland. Although later sources would suggest that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh medical school, there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree and he did not generally refer to himself as <q>Dr. Mitford</q>, preferring to style himself <q>Esq.</q>. In <date when="1784">1784</date>, he is listed in a Hampshire directory as <q>surgeon (medicine)</q> of <placeName ref="#Alresford_Hamps">Alresford</placeName>. His father and grandfather worked as apothecary-surgeons and it seems likely that he served a medical apprenticeship with family members.</p>
                     <p>He married <persName ref="#Russell_M">Mary Russell</persName> on <date when="1785-10-17">October 17, 1785</date> at <placeName>New Alresford, Hampshire</placeName>. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their addresses as <placeName>Old Alresford</placeName>; they later came to live
                        at Broad Street in New Alresford. Their only child to live to adulthood,
                        <persName ref="#MRM">Mary Russell Mitford</persName>, was born two years
                        later on <date when="1787-12-16">December 16, 1787</date> at <placeName>New
                           Alresford, Hampshire</placeName>. He assisted <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName>'s literary career by representing her interests in London and elsewhere with theater owners and publishers. He was active in Whig politics and later served as a local magistrate. He coursed greyhounds with his friend <persName ref="#Webb_James">James Webb</persName>.</p>

See also the Monthly Magazine 12 (1801): 174 obituary for a Joseph Warry, boot and shoemaker of Reading, for 1801, which suggests the possibility that Mr. Warry may be his son who took over the business.

                  <note resp="#lmw">Military commander and political leader. During the French Revolution and Revolutionary Wars, Napoleon rose to prominence as a military leader. He engineered a coup in 1799 that brought him to power as First Consul of France and then as Napoleon I, Emperor of the French (from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815). As Emperor, he led France against a series of European military coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars, building an empire that extended over most of continental Europe until its collapse in 1815. In spring 1814, the Allies captured Paris and forced Napoleon to abdicate, exiling him to the island of Elba and restoring the Bourbons to power. Less than a year later, Napoleon escaped from Elba and retook control of France, only to suffer defeat by the Allies at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. The British then exiled him to the island Saint Helena in the South Atlantic, where he remained until his death in 1821. He is celebrated as one of Europe's greatest military commanders and as the disseminator of the system of laws known as the Napoleonic Code.</note>

                        Charles Fyshe Palmer’s marriage to Lady Madelina thus gained him access to

                     <p>A Whig politician, Palmer began running for Parliament elections as the

                        sometimes undermined his Whig reformist positions by referencing the noble

                     through marriage to <persName>John Russell, Duke of Bedford</persName>. Her
                     brothers were <persName>George Duncan Gordon</persName>, who became 5th Duke of
                     Gordon, and <persName>Lord Alexander Gordon</persName>. <persName ref="#Palmer_CF">Charles Fyshe Palmer</persName>’s marriage to Lady Madelina
                     thus gained him access to aristocratic houses, including the <orgName ref="#HollandHouse">Holland House</orgName>. Lady Madelina’s name is
                     variously spelled <q>Madelina</q> and <q>Madalina</q>, although <q>Madelina</q>
                     appears to be the more common and standard spellling of the name, as an
                     anglicization of the French Madeline. For more on the Palmers, see note 2 in

                     records after 1861, reappearing in 1891, and gives his son Arthur Harry
                     Edmund’s birthplace as Isipingo, Natal, South Africa (then a British colony),
                     it seems possible that he emigrated to South Africa between those dates, then

                     Wakefield, which seems likely, cross-checking with the ODNB. Wakefield's mother

                     converted to the Church of England. He published <title level="m">An Essay on Political
                        Economy</title> in 1799, and qualified for the law in 1807. His first wife,

                     nearly bankrupted him, before she fatally poisoned herself in August 1813.

                        Kilgour</persName>. He was eventually very successful and much consulted on
                     legal cases.</note>

                     <!-- scw: See William Silver Darter [An Octogenarian], who names Warry of Minster Street, "an active liberal," as the person who was sent to France (41), although he says it was the 1812 election. See also the Monthly Magazine 12 (1801): 174 obituary for a Joseph Warry, boot and shoemaker of Reading, for 1801, which suggests the possibility that Mr. Warry may be his son who took over the business. Coles also puzzles over the name in one of Mitford's letters. --></note>

He and William Roberts founded the Christian evangelical periodial the <title level="j">British Review and London Critical Journal</title>, a quarterly that appeared between 1811 and 1825. He authored several publications on population and the English poor laws, including <title level="m">A Short Enquiry into the Policy, Humanity, and Effect of the Poor Laws</title> (1807); <title level="m">Observations on Mr. Whitbread's Poor Bill and on the Population of England</title> (1807); <title level="m">The Principle of the English Poor Laws, illustrated from the Evidence given by Scottish Proprietors (before the Corn Committee,) on the Connexion observed in Scotland between the Price of Grain and the Wages of Labour</title> (1815); and <title level="m">The Principles of Population and Production as they are affected by the Progress of Society</title> (1816). He believed that hardship was an incentive to industry and he did not support further education of the poor. On <date when="1820-03-16">March 16, 1820</date>, Weyland was the Blue (or Tory) candidate, supported by the municipal corporation, in the Reading election. Three candidates ran: <persName ref="#Monck_JB">John Berkeley Monck</persName> (418 votes), <persName ref="#Palmer_CF">Charles Fyshe Palmer</persName>(399 votes), and <persName ref="#Weyland_John">John Weyland</persName> (395 votes.); Weyland was not returned. See <ptr target="http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1820-1832/constituencies/reading"/>. Weyland later won a seat as Member of Parliament for Hindon, Wiltshire, and served from 1830 to 1832.

                  <note resp="#lmw">The Punch and Judy slapstick puppet shows of England had their
                     roots in the 16th-century Italian commedia dell’arte tradition. The figure of
                     Punch derives from the Neapolitan stock character of Pulcinella, whose name was
                     anglicized Punchinello and shortened to Punch. 17th- and 18th-century shows
                     in England were performed with marionettes on fixed stages. By the end of the
                     18th century, shows were performed using glove puppets on mobile puppet booths
                     and found a home on the nineteenth century on the beaches of English seaside
                     resorts and evolved into children’s entertainments in the Victorian era. Mr.
                     Punch is the traditional protagonist of such shows; episodic plots normally
                     involve Punch beating his wife and other characters with his slapstick and
                     end with him defeating even the Devil himself.</note>

                  <note>Historically, a four thousand acre tract of heathland outside London near
                     Hounslow in the county of Middlesex, crossed by major routes between London and
                     the west and southwest of England. In <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName>’s
                     time, the heath was crossed by the Great West Road and the Bath Road and, as it
                     had been in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, was still known as a
                     dangerous spot for unwary travellers who might find themselves robbed by
                     highwaymen or footpads. From at least the English Civil Wars until World War
                     II, the heath has been used as a military staging area and training ground.
                     Today, all that remains of the heath is two hundred acres preserved as
                     parkland.</note>

The Battle of Thermopylae might be metaphorically invoked as shorthand for a noble though inevitable defeat, although given the heavy losses sustained by the victorious Persian army, the battle might also be invoked as an example of a Pyrrhic victory.</note>

Also called the <q>cross adder</q>for the diamond patterns on its back, although melanated individuals may appear entirely brown-black with no visible patterning. One of three snakes native to the UK; the other two are nonvenmous: the barred grass snake and the smooth snake. They have adapted to a wide range of land habitats such as meadows, rough commons and hedgerows, and the edges of woodlands, although they require complex habitats to support basking, hunting for small mammals, amphibians, and insects; protection from predators, and hibernation. The name is derived from the generic word for <q>serpent</q> in Germanic languages, the same term used for snakes and the Devil in the Old Testament. The myth of the <q>deaf adder</q> has its source in Psalms 58: 4 and became proverbial for someone willfully refusing to hear by the early 17th century.</note>

James I introduced the breed to England in 1616 and others were imported in the 18th century to create modern racing breeds such as the English thoroughbred. Marengo, Napoleon's war horse, was an Arabian. Europeans travelling to the middle East in the 19th century began intensively collecting Arabians.</note>

                  <note resp="#lmw">First animal species to be domesticated, before the developmment of farming, by hunter-gatherers more than fifteen thousand years ago. Descended from an ancient, now-extinct wolf species. Modern dog breeds were codified beginning in the late 19th century, with the rise of dog shows and set breed standards. Before that time, dogs were classified by appearance or function and any such may now be considered <soCalled>landrace</soCalled>, traditional, or heritage breeds. More than 50 named dog breeds originated in the UK. Breeds extant during the first half of the nineteenth century include: many terrier breeds in a range of sizes and coat types, originally bred to hunt vermin; several hounds, hunting dogs used to track or chase prey, such as the scenthounds (bloodhounds, harriers, fox hounds) and the sighthounds (greyhound, Irish Wolfhound, Scottish deerhound);  mastiffs such as the English bulldog, Bullmastiff and English mastiff, used in blood sports and as guard dogs; sporting dogs used in bird hunting, such as setters and pointers; and many spaniels, including the Cavalier King Charles, Clumber, Sussex, English springer and English cocker spaniels. Now-extinct predecessor breeds include: Staghound, Buckhound, Talbot hound, Old English Bulldog, Norfolk and Tweed water spaniels, Black and Tan terrier, Cumberland sheepdog, English cur or drover's dog, Curley-coated retriever, English water spaniel, and English white terrier. Most so-called extinct breeds actually contributed bloodlines subsumed by later breeds.</note>

In Britain, the <name ref="#wood_pigeon">wood pigeon</name> is hunted as a game bird and domesticated pigeons were also used as food. In the ancient world, doves were associated with goddesses of love, sexuality, and maternity, such as Inanna Ishtar and Aphrodite. Doves carry symbolic significance in both the Old and New Testaments of the Hebrew Bible: in Genesis in the story of Noah and the ark as a symbol of peace and deliverance, in the Song of Songs as a term of endearment, and in Matthew as a symbol of the Holy Spirit. Doves were also acceptable burnt offerings and came to symbolize peace in early Christianity. Later literary and artistic references often draw on this association of white doves with peace, deliverance, and spiritual gifts, and are representations of the rock dove, which is highly variable in color, ranging from white to shades of grey and pale brown.</note>

The female forms are wingless, and thus became known as <soCalled>worms</soCalled>. Found in old-growth meadows, verges, hedgerows, and heaths, peaking in June and July. A favorite subject for poets from at least the early-modern period; in Mitford's time, a common subject, particularly for sonnets, by authors who include Charlotte Smith, Anna Maria Porter, William Wordsworth, and John Clare.</note>

In the 19th century, kept in zoos and menageries as well as living ornaments to large gardens and estates. Domestic birds may be raised for meat, and their shed tailfeathers are prized for decorative uses. Omnivorous foragers that roost at night, feral birds can adapt to human habitation, roosting on buildings and foraging discarded food and other refuse. Males are known as <q>peacocks</q> and females as <q>peahens</q>, although both are commonly referred to as <q>peacocks</q>.</note>

The males are brightly-colored, with green heads, while the females are drab. Hybridization has bred types in a variety of colors. Pheasants, likely from the Caucasus, were naturalized in Britain by at least 1050 AD, and may have arrived earlier, with the Romans. The ring-necked variety was reintroduced in the 18th century. In the UK, the birds are hunted by traditional driven-shoot methods, employing beaters, and rough-shoot methods; both methods rely on gun dogs to flush and retrieve the birds.</note>

Likely domesticated from wild boar in three separate areas: first in the Near East and China and later in Europe. By the 19th century, native UK breeds included: Tamworth, Large White, Large Black, British Lop, Berkshire, and Oxford Sandy and Black. The Berkshire is considered the oldest British breed; it's a stocky, medium-sized black pig with white patches and legs. The Oxford Sandy and Black developed in Oxfordshire in the 18th century; it's a medium-sized pig with reddish, sandy-colored skin and black patches.</note>

Small dog with a wrinkly, short-haired coat, distinctive short muzzle, and curly tail. They are mostly light brown or red (fawn or apricot) with black markings. Until the 1860s, when more compact, shorter-legged Chinese pugs were imported, English pugs were longer, leaner, and less stocky. European pugs may have been bred with another popular royal lapdog breed, the King Charles spaniel, which contributed to the shorter muzzles of that breed. A fictional pug name <persName>Daphne</persName> appears in one of the Mitford's stories; this dog is described as <quote>a particularly ugly, noisy pug, that barked at every body that came into the house, and bit at most</quote>.</note>

Same species as domesticated rabbits, and raised for meat, fur, and as companion animals. Traditionally the fur has been felted for hats as well as used to line garments. The meat was an important staple in the diet of the poorer classes, purchased, hunted or trapped, sometimes in violation of game and enclosure laws enacted from the 18th century forward. Prefer grasslands with nearby treelines or hedges. Native to the Iberian peninsula and southern France, but has been widely introduced elsewhere. UK rabbits are believed to have come with the Normans and populations increased during the eighteenth-century with changing agricultural methods such as predator control and field crop farming.</note>

They may have solid or parti-colored coats in black, liver, red, or golden, with tan masking and trim, roan patching, or <q>ticked</q> spots.  The most common color is liver (dark brown/chocolate) and white. The Sussex spaniel, first recorded in 1795, is a stocky spaniel with a distinctive golden-brown colored coat and hazel eyes.

Associated with Apollo and Venus in classical mythology. Symbolic of purity, because of their color; and faithful love, since swans are believed to grieve for the loss or death of a mate or cygnet. Mythologized as singing beautifully before their death, and thus, identified with extraordinary singers or poets; for example, referring to Shakespeare as the <q>swan of Avon</q>.</note>

UK terrier breeds appear in a range of sizes and coat types, and were originally bred to be fearless and agile in order hunt vermin (rats, foxes) underground. Terriers were used in blood sports such as rat-catching. Terriers and bulldog-terrier mixes were also used in dogfighting. Two notable heritage breeds, now extinct, include the black-and-tan terrier and the English white terrier.

Cultivated varieties developed from wild trees in Central Asia, and have likely been domesticated for at least four thousand years. Before the invention of refrigeration, the fruit was important for its ability to be dried, to overwinter in cold storage and to produce fermented cider. While the apple appears in many mythological and religious traditions as a mystical or forbidden object, as in the forbidden Edenic fruit in the Old Testament, the term generally referred to any edible or non-native fruit, and did not necessarily indicate fruits of the genus Malus. There are currently more than 7,000 apple cultivars and the University of Reading, in Berkshire, is responsible for the UK national apple database. <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName> mentions at least three varieties: <q>golden rennet</q> or Golden Reinette also known as the <soCalled>English pippin</soCalled>, a golden-yellow apple, streaked red-orange; <q>russetting</q> types, apples whose smooth skin is covered all or in part by rougher brown skin, thought to have more nutty and aromatic flavors than non-russeting types and used in cider making; and a <q>crumpling</q>type; an underdeveloped or deformed apple that shrivels on the tree.</note>

                     temperate Europe, Asia and North America. <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName> likely refers to the European
                     beech (Fagus sylvatica) which is considered native to the southern UK and introduced elsewhere for tall hedging and plantations, particularly after the eighteenth century. More recently, research suggests the beech was introduced into England around 4,000 B.C. and so is non-native. Beech woods are densely canopied with floors suitable only for shade-loving understory plants such as <name type="#bluebell">bluebell</name>s. The bark is smooth and light grey and the tree bears inconspicuous flowers and catkins that develop into husk-enclosed nuts that are bitter but edible. The nuts and bark are high in tannins, used to tan leather, and the trees produce a fine-grained medium-weight wood used for indoor flooring, staircases, and small furniture. It also makes good firewood, as well as wood pulp for papermaking.</note>

Cultivated varieties are grown for their fibrous stalks and their seeds, which are used as a spice. It is thought to be native to the Mediterranean region, and has been cultivated since antiquity, in winter and early spring. Further hybridization by the 19th century had extended the growing season, and celery became an increasing important raw and cooked vegetable in British, American and European cuisines.</note>

Native to India and Himalaya, western China, and northern Thailand and now cultivated as a vegetable worldwide. Cultivated in the UK from the 14th century and seemingly reintroduced in the 16th century, when they frequently appear pickled. Cultivated in North America since the 16th century, likely imported by Europeans into the Americas and embraced by Native Americans as additions to their native vining crops like squash. During the 18th century, the cucumber, along with other summer fruits and vegetables eaten raw, gained a reputation for being unwholesome and a cause of stomach disorders. Continued to be cultivated, however, and their reputation began to recover in the 19th century. Cucumbers are mentioned in Dickens's novels, associated with comic characters of questionable sanity or morals: in Nicholas Nickleby, they are a courtship overture from an unbalanced suitor to Mrs. Nickelby and in Martin Chuzzlewit, they are a favorite of Sairey Gamp.</note>

Outside their native range, dahlia tubers are susceptible to frost, and must have their tubers dug over winter and replanted, if they are not grown in greenhouses. <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName> raised and hybridized dahlias.</note>

                  <note resp="#tfb #lmw">The so-called <soCalled>English elm</soCalled> is a deciduous tree with serrated leaves, a variety of the European <soCalled>field elm</soCalled>, introduced into England from Spain in the 16th century. Before Dutch elm disease decimated the population in the 20th century, mature elm trees were a prominent feature of mixed deciduous forests and were also frequently used in landscape gardening. In England, elms were found in mixed forests with oak and ash, often near rivers. While populations still exist, they do not grow to mature size, and so immature elms are today mainly found in hedgerows. Because of its resistance to rot, elm was frequently used to construct medieval water pipes as well as piers, jetties, and lock gates. Because of its resistance to splitting, it was also used to make chair seats, coffins, wagon wheel hubs, and bows. During the enclosure movement, elms were plants in hawthorn hedges, and avenues and groves of elms were popular features of 18th- and 19th-century landscape gardening. Wych elm, also called witch hazel or Scots elm, is also native to the UK. Ancient Roman literature spoke of a <soCalled>marriage</soCalled> between the elm and the vine, in which the elm represented the husband and the vine the wife, because of the Roman practice of planting elms in vineyards to support grape vines; in British literature, this motif appears most frequently as elm and ivy. The ancient Greek tradition of planting elms on graves has also given rise to a <soCalled>elm-and-death</soCalled> motif. They are also frequently mentioned in classical pastoral poetry, where their cool shade is praised as paradisal.</note>

Naturalists debate whether it is native to the UK or imported and naturalized before the 16th century.</note>

There is a white variety cultivated in gardens, but no pink one. I have heard both the harebell and the wild hyacinth called blue-bells</q>. In the UK, the harbell may flower from July to November. <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName> also uses the term <name ref="#campanula">campanula</name>, which may be used for any member of the bellflower family, but <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName> may use to refer to <soCalled>Canterbury bells</soCalled> (Campanula medium), a taller bellflower than the harebell, native to southern Europe but cultivated as a garden plant in Britain.</note>

Ancient Roman literature spoke of a <soCalled>marriage</soCalled> between the elm and the vine, in which the elm represented the husband and the vine the wife, because of their practice of planting elms in vineyards to support the vines; in British literature, this motif appears most frequently as elm (or oak) and ivy. <title level="a">The Holly and the Ivy</title> is a traditional English folk song that dates from the early nineteenth century, or earlier.

                  <note resp="#lmw #slc">Mitford likely refers to the common or English oak (Quercus robur), a variety of white oak, although the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) is also native to the Europe and the UK. Large, long-lived deciduous hardwood tree with lobed leaves, hanging catkins in spring, and then acorns, oval nuts with woody caps. In 19th-century English forests, oak was the predominant deciduous tree, often found with <name ref="#ash">ash</name> and <name ref="#elm">elm</name>. A hard wood with a distinctive light-and-dark grain, used since the early medieval period for making sturdy furniture, flooring, doors, household items such as chests and buckets, and for building sailing ships, particularly large naval vessels. Because the tree is large, strong and long-lived, it has accumulated numerous symbolic and national associations, particularly in the UK. In English folklore, Robin Hood hid in an oak to escape pursuers, and the oak became a national symbol after the future <persName ref="#ChasII">Charles II</persName> reportedly hid in an oak during the <rs type="event" ref="#EngCivilWar">English Civil Wars</rs>. This tree became known as the <soCalled>Royal Oak</soCalled>, and led to a national celebration of <soCalled>Oak Apple Day</soCalled> in May. <q>Royal Oak</q> became a popular pub name, as well as the name of several Royal Navy warships. The symbolic association between Britain's military strength and the strength of its men is encapsulated in the song <title level="a">Heart of Oak</title>, written in 1759 and revised in 1809: <quote>Heart of oak are our ships,/Hearts of oak are our men</quote>. Oak leaves, like laurel, were used as ceremonial wreaths and crowns, and both oak leaves and acorns appeared as neoclassical ornaments. The proverb <q>great oaks from little acorns grow</q>, dates from at least the 16th century, and the concept appears in Chaucer's <title level="m">Troilus and Criseyde</title>.

Tropical species have been grown in the UK in glasshouses since the 19th century and are also cultivated for sale at florist's shops, as corsages, cut flowers, or pot plants. Scented varieties may be used in perfumery; and vanilla bean pods, with culinary uses, derive from an orchid species. 19th c. Europe and the UK saw a craze for collecting and hybridizing wild orchid species collected from elsewhere,  called orchidelirium, orchidomania or orchid fever, similar to the 17th-century Dutch tulip mania.</note>

The genus is small leggy plant with showy flower clusters in shades of red, pink, purple, and white; native to southern Africa and Australia, and is grown as an annual garden plant worldwide, although zonal pelargoniums are perennial in their native tropical climates. The majority of pelargoniums grown as annual bedding plants worldwide originated in South Africa.</note>

Sometimes the numbering can be off from the actual month/year that the issue was published, and this may have led to the bibliographic confusion of dates.

Inspired by a manuscript translated from the Italian by Mary Shelley (who also claimed to have discussed with her husband the play's scene breakdown), The Cenci tells a powerful story of political tyranny, incestuous rape, and violent, quickly-suppressed revolt. The play's depiction of rape, incest, and parricide was the apparent cause of its rejection by the Theatre at Covent Garden. It was not produced until 1886, when it premiered in an unlicensed London performance organized by the actor Alma Murray, who played Beatrice.</note>

                  <!--SCW: More research may be needed on the reprint history of the Christmas Amusements series. They are essentially charades and dramatics. Edinburgh Tales is an anthology of Tait's Edinburgh Magazine publications, which had been Johnstone's Edinburgh Magazine prior to June 1834, and based on the repub of CA in Edinburgh Tales, my sense it that CA were published there first. I wasn't able to find copies of then online to verify and date.-->

                  <publisher>published for the author [Charles Dickinson]</publisher>
                  <note resp="#lmw">First published in 1795 and privately printed by Charles
                     Dickinson himself. Period records suggest that the poem was available in at
                     least four different forms: as individual quarto cantos sold for 1 shilling
                     each (some listing ’White’ as the name of the publisher, although this may be a
                     bookseller); as a 1796 quarto complete edition of all sixty-six cantos; as
                     partial quarto editions of the middle 40 cantos (possibly gathered from
                     individual cantos, as each were numbered separately); and a 12mo. complete
                     edition in two volumes, with 389 pages listed as printed at Farley-Hill in
                     1820, of which only 12 copies were made and which were presentation copies to
                     Dickinson’s friends. Some editions appear <q>in boards,</q> others in <q>half
                     morocco.</q> An auction catalog for Richard Valpy’s library indicates that there
                     were <q>only 12 copies, printed by the author himself, who presented this to me
                     (ie, Richard Valpy);</q> another presentation copy appears in an auction catalogs
                     for Samuel Rogers’s library. Periodicals and their reviewers from 1796 do not
                     appear to have had access to the complete work in 66 cantos but instead review
                     partial editions of cantos 41-60 (Edinburgh Magazine); canto 38 only
                     (Analytical Review); Cantos 38-60 (British Critic); Cantos 38 and 40 only
                     (Monthly Review). WorldCat lists an edition of cantos 37 to 60 only from 1795.
                     Separate listings for a two-page mock title-page for the work, attributed to
                     Horne-Took, appear as <q>Speedily will be published, price 3l.6s. in boards, The
                     travels of Cyllenius: a poem. In sixty-six cantos.</q>

                  <note resp="#rnes #lmw">Three-act historical drama collaboratively written by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey. At the time of the play's writing, it was printed by radical Benjamin Flower but never performed. The play, drafted soon after Robespierre's death, presents a complex portrait of Maximilien Robespierre, political architect (and eventual victim) of the Reign of Terror that followed the French Revolution. This play proved an embarrassment to Southey after his repudiation of his youthful radicalism.</note>

                     from 110 letters addressed by the author to <persName ref="#Pennant_Thomas">Thomas Pennant</persName>, a zoologist, and <persName>Daines
                           Barrington</persName>, a fellow of the Royal Society. In each letter, some
                     of which were composed for the book itself, White describes his observations of
                     local natural surroundings, flora, fauna, and geologic formation in minute
                     detail. These observations were carefully prepared from notes White took over
                     time, and were meant to be a scientific record of the natural phenomena under
                     discussion, coupled with an assessment of the social conditions of the area.
                     The book was immensely successful, and is considered an early example of
                     ecological exploration. It was a favorite book of <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName>'s, and she invokes it as a formal model for <title level="m" ref="#OV">Our Village</title> in the introductory sketch, and

This selected edition of <title ref="#OV">Our Village</title> compiles stories from across the five volumes, and arranges them in the order in which they originally appeared. The only exception to this ordering is what was the introduction to <title ref="#OurVillage_5th">the fifth volume</title>, <title ref="#Intro_Farewell_to_OV_v5">Introduction: Farewell to Our Village</title>, which becomes the last story in the volume; moving the <q>farewell</q> to the last position appears to be a common practice with editors of selected editions.</note>

This volume featured an extensive Introduction by <persName ref="#Ritchie_AnneT">Anne Thackeray Ritchie</persName> and new black and white illustrations by <persName ref="#Thomson_Hugh">Hugh Thomson</persName>. The volume reprints the <title ref="#Walks_Country_OV">Walks in the Country</title> subseries of sketches and re-orders them chronologically to follow the seasons, winter-spring-summer-fall; a choice and ordering of stories that others would follow. The firm produced a limited-run <q>large paper</q> edition in red cloth as well as a <q>small paper</q> quarto edition bound in green cloth, some with gilt-stamped covers. The <q>small paper</q> green cloth editions featured illustrated covers and spines heavily stamped in gold, and followed a book design strategy that had been established by <orgName ref="#Macmillan_pub">Macmillan</orgName> in 1891 with editions of <persName ref="#Gaskell_Eliz">Gaskell</persName>'s <title ref="#Cranford">Cranford</title> and <persName ref="#Goldsmith">Goldsmith</persName>'s <title ref="#Vicar_Wakefield">Vicar of Wakefield</title>; these editions were also illustrated by <persName ref="#Thomson_Hugh">Hugh Thomson</persName> and were popular as gift books. The large paper edition was limited to 470 copies and used the same illustration plates as the small paper edition.</note>

                     printing themselves and printed only 50 copies, because the bankrupt Duke could
                     not finance the venture. In her February 27, 1819 letter to Elford, Mitford
                     indicates that she does not expect him to buy a copy, since he is <q>a great deal
                     too wise to deal in books printed upon drawing paper in Atlas quarto--books
                     merely meant to make a show.</q> It is unknown how many copies were sold.</note>
