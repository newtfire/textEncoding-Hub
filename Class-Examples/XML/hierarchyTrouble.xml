    Is it deliberate how far they make you go
    especially if you live in the city to get far 
    enough away from home to see not just trees 
    but only trees? The boring highways, roadsigns, high 
    speeds, 10-axle trucks passing you as if they were 
    in an even greater hurry than you to look at leaves:
    so you drive in terror for literal hours and it looks 
    like rain, or snow, but it's probably just clouds
    (too cloudy to see any color?) and you wonder, 
    given the poverty of your memory, which road had the 
    most color last year, but it doesn't matter since 
    you're probably too late anyway, or too earlyâ€”
    whichever road you take will be the wrong one
    and you've probably come all this way for nothing.
