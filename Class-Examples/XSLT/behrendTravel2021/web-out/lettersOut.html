            July 26th letter
            
            
            <p><span class="date"> July 26, 1955</span></p>
            <span class="placeName">Brussels</span>
            
            
            
            <p>Dear People:</p>
            
            <p>We are just about to take off for <span class="placeName">Copenhagen</span> and are sit- ting
               around so I will try to send this second installment of our trip report. If I
               remember correctly, the last letter came from the boat. We arrived in
               <span class="placeName">Cherbourg</span> and got safely on the train to
               fin that it was over 90. We nearly died on the ride to <span class="placeName">Paris</span>. Very
               unairconditioned train and blazing sun. The first thing we did when we arrived at
               <span class="placeName">Le Bristol</span> was fall in cold tub. We went out for
               dinner later and cele- brater with <span class="persName">Charles
                  Jubilee</span>. Very tasty! The next day Mrs. Behrend hired a
               car and guide and we drove all over <span class="placeName">Paris</span>.
               It is so beautiful but so expensive<span class="x" title="?">!</span>
               $90 a minute to breath! We did a bit of shopping, had lunch in the
               <span class="placeName">Bois de Boulougne</span> shopped on the Left Bank, got
               train tickets and that night went to the <span class="placeName">Casino de
                  Paris</span>. Pretty naked ladies I must say. We were not carried away by it
               but did see it, so that is that.</p>
            
            <p>The next morning we were up at the crack of dawn and off to Tours. The man and
               his wife who ran the <span class="placeName">Manior Berheron</span>, where we stayed as a
               mmber of the family were terribly nice. We
               arravied in time for lunch and then got in a little car and went
               through some beautiful country to see some of the chateaux. We enjoyed it
               traemndously. You can see where the old French painters get all their inspirations.
               Lovely rivers, old mills and beautiful trees. That night after dinner we
               went to a nearby chateau, <span class="placeName">Azay-le-Rideau</span> which was illuminated. Just like fairyland.
               They also had a sort of play very cleverly done just done with voices and lighting
               which told the history of the building. We will never forget it.</p>
            
            <p>Thursday, the Davidsons, our hosts and their little boy and and
               ourselves went on another chateaux trip which was just a grand as the day before.
               We
               had a picnic on the way and <span class="x" title=""><span class="hand">tea</span></span> on the way home. Great
               fun. The only thing that marred the trip was another guest who arrived who knew all
               about everything and told it in the loudest of voices. I got in a ter- rible row
               with him about sports. Everyone was on my side but you couldn't get a word in edge
               wise. Itwas rather funny to look back on but I nearly had a nervous breakdown when
               it was going on.</p>
            
            
            <p>
               Friday we left Tours at about eleven and got back in Paris for
               lunch. After the lovely meal we changed out on foot to do some
               shopping.</p>
            
            
            
            
            July 26th letter
            
            
            
            
            <p>and walked around. This we dis. Not too many purchases. We were going upto
               <span class="placeName">montmartre</span> but decided to get to bed early to leave for
               <span class="placeName">Brussels</span> the next day.</p>
            
            <p>We had a perfect flight from <span class="placeName">London</span> here. Mercedes Bucher met us
               at the airport and we came to the hotel. the Wilsons, Mrs. BBs cousin, called and
               came over for a drink. We then went for a delicious lunch, food is
               marvelous here, on the <span class="placeName">Grand Place</span> which is fantatic. Mercedes has a
               car so we spent the afternoon seeing
               <span class="placeName">Brussels</span> which is very pretty. Lovely park and old buildings. Had
               dinner in a very old place with lots of atmoshpere and good food.
               Sunday we piled into the car and went to
               <span class="placeName">Burges</span>, about and hour and a half away. A divine old town. We
               took a ride in a carriage all over the town. Great fun. On
               the way back we stopped for tea in the <span class="placeName">Osten</span> which is
               a big seaside resort. Arrived back here at eight and ha a light supper
               on the <span class="placeName">Grand Place</span> which is illuminated at night and breathtaking.
               Yesterday we shopped most of the day and walked around seeing things. All had
               cocktails at the <span class="placeName">Wilsons hotel</span> and dinner
               later.</p>
            
            <p> It is now Tuesday again and we leave here at 12:55 for
               <span class="placeName">Copen- hagen</span> arriving there at 4:30. Have to change
               planes in <span class="placeName">Amsterdam</span>. Mer- bill etc. The <span class="persName">Wilsons</span> left
               a while ago for <span class="placeName">Paris</span>. We will see them in <span class="placeName">London</span> in
               August.</p>
            
            <p>We see by the paper that it is still unberable in <span class="placeName">New York</span> and
               are pleased to be here. weather has been perfect except for the day we arrived.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>Much love to all from both of us.</p>

            <p>
               <span class="placeName">The Manoir de Bécheron</span> is a private home which welcomes a few paying guests. It is a rambling 15th-16th Century house

               with modern comfort. The cuisine is French, meals are 'en famille', except for breakfast,
               which is served in your room 
               or if you choose, in the gardens.
               You are one of us when we go visiting our French and American neighbors. Among them
               are such famous artists as <span class="persName">Alexander

               while touring <span class="placeName">Europe, Bécheron</span> is

               A week in <span class="placeName">Bécheron</span> is over before you realize it! You won't want to miss the thrilling sight of the
               illuminated chateaux;

               a few of the fabulous palaces which surround us.

               Loire across from <span class="placeName">Mme. de Pompadour's palace at Ménars</span>. We will also take you to one of the outstanding restaurants of Tours 
               on a picturesque medieval square.

               a very unhealthy looking green duffle bag(reserved for purchases. THIS folded up on

               We had a table in the <span class="placeName">dining</span> room with 5 other femal ladies. Thought it would divert us. The one man looked us
               over and
               next meal he wasn't there. So we dr4ew ano anoother lady. It all proved to be amusing. We exchange addresses and werephotographed
               to-gether. 
               Voyage very smooth all way over. We took in the <span class="placeName">movies</span> and <span class="placeName">pools</span>. I won a few dollars on a pool.
               A <span class="persName">Mr and Mrs Andeson</span>, very nice friends of <span class="persName">H.</span> and <span class="persName">Caryls</span> asked us for cocktails one evening. Then there

               Both exptremely cordial. 
               Took train around noon for <span class="placeName">Paris</span>. Hot as blazes. and stuffy besides. Had lunch en route. Quite good.
               <span class="placeName">Paris</span> and piled our belongings intoo a cab and landed at <span class="placeName">Le Br istol</span>- a rather smallish hotel were diplomats go- white marble 
               and mirrors. We had an oval white panelled round sitting room. (which we didn't need
               and later gave up.)
               Very weary and after some refreshing tub baths went over to the <span class="placeName">Crenailliere</span>(nearby) where we had a very delicious dinner.</p>
