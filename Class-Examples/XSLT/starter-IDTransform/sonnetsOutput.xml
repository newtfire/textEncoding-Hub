    <ln n="6"/>When I was wont to greet it with my lays;
    <ln n="7"/>As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,

    <ln n="9"/>Not that the summer is less pleasant now
    <ln n="10"/>Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,
    <ln n="11"/>But that wild music burthens every bough,
    <ln n="12"/>And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.

    <ln n="9"/>For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,
    <ln n="10"/>Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy;
    <ln n="11"/>And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,
    <ln n="12"/>Or made them swear against the thing they see;
    <ln n="13"/>For I have sworn thee fair; more perjur'd I,
    <ln n="14"/>To swear against the truth so foul a lie!

    <ln n="1"/>Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep:
    <ln n="2"/>A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
    <ln n="3"/>And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
    <ln n="4"/>In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;
    <ln n="5"/>Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love,
    <ln n="6"/>A dateless lively heat, still to endure,
    <ln n="7"/>And grew a seeting bath, which yet men prove
    <ln n="8"/>Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.
    <ln n="9"/>But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
    <ln n="10"/>The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;
    <ln n="11"/>I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,
    <ln n="12"/>And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,
    <ln n="13"/>But found no cure, the bath for my help lies
    <ln n="14"/>Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.

    <ln n="1"/>The little Love-god lying once asleep,
    <ln n="2"/>Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
    <ln n="3"/>Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
    <ln n="4"/>Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
    <ln n="5"/>The fairest votary took up that fire
    <ln n="6"/>Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;
    <ln n="7"/>And so the general of hot desire
    <ln n="8"/>Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarm'd.
    <ln n="9"/>This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
    <ln n="10"/>Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
    <ln n="11"/>Growing a bath and healthful remedy,
    <ln n="12"/>For men diseas'd; but I, my mistress' thrall,
    <ln n="13"/>Came there for cure and this by that I prove,
    <ln n="14"/>Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.
