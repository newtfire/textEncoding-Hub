    <poemLine n="8"/>Desire is death, which physic did except.
    <poemLine n="9"/>Past cure I am, now Reason is past care,
    <poemLine n="10"/>And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;
    <poemLine n="11"/>My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
    <poemLine n="12"/>At random from the truth vainly express'd;
    <poemLine n="13"/>For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
    <poemLine n="14"/>Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.

    <poemLine n="11"/>No marvel then, though I mistake my view;
    <poemLine n="12"/>The sun itself sees not, till heaven clears.
    <poemLine n="13"/>O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,
