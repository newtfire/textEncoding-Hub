            AUGUST 25th LEAVING STALHEIM FOR ULVICK
            Deci ed that, if we could get rooms at Ulvick we woud
            le ve Stalheim and go on. As nothing much to do here
            except look at the views nd CLIMB about. Had the usual
            heary laden Smorgesbrod-but this time with nohest to
            goodness electric toaster- so we had TOAST. We strolled
            around and went into the 'pill box" the Germans had
            built in a spot overlooking everything. Peeked into the
            so called museum- three little wooden houses grass roofs.
            filled with old wooden farm shovels, , buckets etc.It wou ld
            notbe open until 11 and anyway we have, by now, seen a
            number of these museums and somemvery fine ones.
            Sat on the terrace and talked with Mrs. Maxwell- Mr
            Clothier was out for a walk with three sturdy English girl
            girls.These girls walked 7 miles yesterday
            So we departed with a lunch, about noon. Southward.
            Huge blue busses were continuely wheeling up to the
            hotel before we left. Some having met the steamers
            and others coming over the roads from quite some distance.
            Along by the edge of the fjoyd we stopped to fish and
            to have out lunch. The lunch was HORRIBLE bad meat. I hope
            we don't catch anything from the one bite.Also no, fish.
            But a lovely place near some low water falls.
            But the little Sunkist oranges were all right
            I my pocket I had some crackers snitched_from the
            breaffast table'A, 2 o'clock
            stopped to photograph the beautiful Twindefoss Falls.
            T thi nk Twin Falls'!!F om here 45 kilometres to Ulvick.The distances ar not great but           the roads are
            narrow and winding- so one drives slowly therefore to go a few miles takes awhile
            People in the fields raking up the hay.
            They do it three in a row and rake in unison. Smart , Voss, where we turned
            South.
            Quite a town
            Many neat new cement
            buildings and some industries.
            Snow ploughs
            along the road sides all neatly painted- ready for the winter. Smallchildren
            on skis	2 to 3 years start to pratice First hey just stand on them then take a few
            slides etc
            S uth from Voss passing a sort of minig project. WE stopped to ask about it. Slate for
            the roofs.
