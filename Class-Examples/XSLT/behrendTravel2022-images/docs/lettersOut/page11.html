               <span class="corr" title="miss text">Deci ed</span> that, if we could get rooms at <span class="place">Ulvick</span> we <span class="corr" title="spell err">woud</span>
               <span class="corr" title="">le ve</span> <span class="place">Stalheim</span> and go on. As nothing much to do here
               except look at the views <span class="corr" title="spell err">nd</span> CLIMB about. Had the usual
               heary laden <span class="corr" title="spell err">Smorgesbrod</span>-but this time with <span class="corr" title="spell type">nohest</span> to
               goodness electric toaster- so we had TOAST. We strolled
               around and went into the 'pill box" the Germans had
               built in a spot overlooking everything. Peeked into the
               so called museum- three little wooden houses grass roofs.
               filled with old wooden farm shovels, , buckets etc.It <span class="corr" title="spell err">wou ld</span>
               <span class="corr" title="spell err">notbe</span> open until 11 and anyway we have, by now, seen a
               number of these museums and <span class="corr" title="spell err">somemvery</span> fine ones.
               Sat on the terrace and talked with Mrs. Maxwell- Mr
               Clothier was out for a walk with three sturdy English girl
               girls.These girls walked 7 miles yesterday
               So we departed with a lunch, about noon. Southward.
               Huge blue busses were continuely wheeling up to the
               hotel before we left. Some having met the steamers
               and others coming over the roads from quite some distance.
               Along by the edge of the <span class="corr" title="">fjoyd</span> we stopped to fish and
               to have out lunch. The lunch was HORRIBLE bad meat. I hope
               we don't catch anything from the one bite.Also no, fish.
               But a lovely place near some low water falls.
               But the little Sunkist oranges were all right
               I my pocket I had some crackers snitched_from the
               <span class="corr" title="spell err">breaffast</span> table'A, 2 o'clock
               stopped to photograph the beautiful Twindefoss Falls.
               <span class="corr" title="spell err">T thi nk</span> Twin Falls'!!F om here 45 kilometres to Ulvick.The distances <span class="corr" title="spell err">ar</span> not great but           the roads are
               narrow and winding- so one drives slowly therefore to go a few miles takes awhile
               People in the fields raking up the hay.
               They do it three in a row and rake in unison. Smart , Voss, where we turned
               South.
               Quite a town
               Many neat new cement
               buildings and some industries.
               Snow ploughs
               along the road sides all neatly painted- ready for the winter. <span class="corr" title="spell err">Smallchildren</span>
