            Loen about 9. With a picnic. Went Ea_tfor a few miles - Toward the glacier where we
            were yesterday. Then north and east around the end of the Nord Fjord passing little
            clusters
            ofhouses. Edges of bright orange seaweed along the edges of the water. The water is
            a bit
            (line cuts off) salt and sea gulls skim about. Even tho it is many miles from the
            Sea.
            Beautiful vista- across the water. (image on side of
            page) Road winding allng the
            wates edge. Thro Utvik Went high up thro pine

            Some of the old farms were of intereest- 16 more or less- buildings in a group Clear
            reflections in the river. Like glass and yet it is always moving. Often great rocks
            in the
            river bed where teh river rushes noisiluy thdough. Brilliant green iin the bumpy meadows-
            like fairy moss. Several cream colored ponies stopped us in the road- we got out and
