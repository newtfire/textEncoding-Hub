               Left Loen for Balestrand Aug 22 Departed from
               Loen about 9. With a picnic. Went <span class="corr" title="miss text">Ea_t</span>for a few miles - Toward the glacier where we
               were yesterday. Then north and east around the end of the Nord Fjord passing little
               clusters
               ofhouses. Edges of bright orange seaweed along the edges of the water. The water is
               a bit
               (line cuts off) salt and sea gulls skim about. Even tho it is many miles from the
               Sea.
               Beautiful vista- across the water. (image on side of
               page) Road winding <span class="corr" title="spell err">allng</span> the

               sliding down into the fjord and killing manypeople- there is a tablet on the way to
               the
               glacierto <span class="corr" title="spell err">commerate</span> onesuch happening. <span class="corr" title="miss text">S__ow</span> <span class="corr" title="spell err">cappee</span> mountains.
               Stopped at a little village by a rushing frothy river, and bought some soft drinks
               from a
               pretty round faced girl Again went very high over a mountain range- with grand views
               Carpets
               of fern. Photographed a very WIDE waterfall At the summit we got out and waited <span class="corr" title="spell err">zwhile</span> until
               the spark plugs were cleaned. It was a sort of rest place People having coffeein the
               sun.
               Some of the old farms were of intereest- 16 more or less- buildings in a group Clear
               reflections in the river. Like glass and yet it is always moving. Often great rocks
               in the
               river bed where teh river rushes <span class="corr" title="spell err">noisiluy</span> thdough. Brilliant green iin the bumpy meadows-
               like fairy moss. Several cream colored ponies stopped us in the road- we got out and
               fed
               them biscuts '<span class="corr" title="spell err">Luch</span> by the roadside from the Hotel Alexandra's nice picnic. A_ter an hourwe
               continued Magnificent views. Before us the Sojne <span class="corr" title="spell err">fjoyd</span> surrounded by snow capped mountains.
