            <div class="letterText"> No one drives very fast- quite the opposite in fact, if another car is coming <span class="corr" title="spell err">t owrd</span> us one or the other drive will quickly look the situation over and back up into a
               place wide enough so the other car can pass. Many tourists from these countries and
               <span class="corr" title="overlap"><span class="place">Englland</span></span> etc seem to travel the sturdy little <span class="corr" title="spell err">fjoyd</span> steamers and between <span class="corr" title="spell err">fjoyds</span> by bus. The Belgians build a smallish red bus with a good deal of glass- high wide
               windows and glass over the roof- where shirred <span class="corr" title="spell err">curtaions</span> can be pulled over when the sun is too hot.
               BUT the great HUGE busses go skimmimg
               along over these hair-raising <span class="corr" title="cross out">t</span>roads as well. The steamer pick up and carry along, all sorts of merchandise for the
               people living in the small villages. Also all mail as well as <span class="corr" title="spell err">suppies</span> for the hotels and little inns are del<span class="corr" title="miss text"></span>livered in this manner. At <span class="place">Kaupanger</span> 2.30 had a sort of lunch in a <span class="corr" title="miss text">bran</span> new lunch room,<span class="corr" title="spell err">iwith</span> a porch on second floor where the tourists were busy with coffee etc. In a little
               shop below I got some post cards also a funny wooden hook(to copy for the bazaar in
               Greenwich' )Took funny little ferry</div>
            <div class="letterText"><span class="place">Sogndal</span> to <span class="place">Loftsnes</span>- about 5 minutes across
               Run attached to wire cables. Doodle of figure, presumably a girl, holding something in her arms is featured on
               the right side of the page.
               A bridge is BEING
               built across this narrow place. A little girl was selling plums in tiny paper<span class="corr" title="miss text"></span>cornicopias.
               Very sweet and good.
               after continuing
               <span class="corr" title="spell err">alo ng</span> the "river" we took the larger steamer on which were sandwiched in about a dozen
               cars plus a lot of people - and proceeded up the big <span class="corr" title="spell err">fioyd</span>. Grand views at <span class="corr" title="spell err">erevy</span> turn. And
               of course many waterfalls. The left side of the page features a doodle of a factory chimney with the caption
               "Curious factory chimney by the way."This is the
               deepest and largest <span class="corr" title="spell err">fjoyd</span> as before mentioned'
               Arrived at <span class="place">Gudvangen</span>
               end of <span class="corr" title="spell err">fjoyd</span>- that is, end of this "arm" of it.There was some excitement in untangling the motor
               cars and trucks. Then we started UP THE GRADE to the Stalheim
               hotel-way on top of an especially high spot.
               A red building sprawled all over the place.A Mrs Maxwell and her brother Mr Clothier
               were also <span class="corr" title="spell err">st opp</span>
               same hotel So we saw<span class="corr" title="miss text"></span>them later and discussed "DOONERS"
               The funny feather lined puffs that are used on ALL beds everywhere around here. These
               are just laid on the beds and not tucked in.
               Rugs all around walls in dining room
               a great ski place.maps of the runs all <span class="corr" title="spell err">adound</span> the rooms. The bottom of the page features a doodle of a person laying in bed with a blanket
               over them. The caption reads "The 'dooner' Pull it up &amp; feet stick out!" </div>
