         <div class="letterText"> No one drives very fast- quite the opposite in fact, if another car is coming t owrd us one or the other drive will quickly look the situation over and back up into a
            place wide enough so the other car can pass. Many tourists from these countries and
            Englland etc seem to travel the sturdy little fjoyd steamers and between fjoyds by bus. The Belgians build a smallish red bus with a good deal of glass- high wide
            windows and glass over the roof- where shirred curtaions can be pulled over when the sun is too hot.
            BUT the great HUGE busses go skimmimg
            along over these hair-raising troads as well. The steamer pick up and carry along, all sorts of merchandise for the
            people living in the small villages. Also all mail as well as suppies for the hotels and little inns are dellivered in this manner. At Kaupanger 2.30 had a sort of lunch in a bran new lunch room,iwith a porch on second floor where the tourists were busy with coffee etc. In a little
            shop below I got some post cards also a funny wooden hook(to copy for the bazaar in
            Greenwich' )Took funny little ferry</div>
         <div class="letterText">Sogndal to Loftsnes- about 5 minutes across
            Run attached to wire cables. Doodle of figure, presumably a girl, holding something in her arms is featured on
            the right side of the page.
            A bridge is BEING
            built across this narrow place. A little girl was selling plums in tiny papercornicopias.
            Very sweet and good.
            after continuing
            alo ng the "river" we took the larger steamer on which were sandwiched in about a dozen
            cars plus a lot of people - and proceeded up the big fioyd. Grand views at erevy turn. And
            of course many waterfalls. The left side of the page features a doodle of a factory chimney with the caption
            "Curious factory chimney by the way."This is the
            deepest and largest fjoyd as before mentioned'
            Arrived at Gudvangen
            end of fjoyd- that is, end of this "arm" of it.There was some excitement in untangling the motor
            cars and trucks. Then we started UP THE GRADE to the Stalheim
            hotel-way on top of an especially high spot.
            A red building sprawled all over the place.A Mrs Maxwell and her brother Mr Clothier
            were also st opp
            same hotel So we sawthem later and discussed "DOONERS"
            The funny feather lined puffs that are used on ALL beds everywhere around here. These
            are just laid on the beds and not tucked in.
            Rugs all around walls in dining room
            a great ski place.maps of the runs all adound the rooms. The bottom of the page features a doodle of a person laying in bed with a blanket
            over them. The caption reads "The 'dooner' Pull it up &amp; feet stick out!" </div>
