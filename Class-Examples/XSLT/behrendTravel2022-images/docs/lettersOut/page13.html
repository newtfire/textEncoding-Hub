               collected a little assortment of cracker for the trip this P.M.(as one never can be
               sure
               where we eat next on these trips.)We wandered down to the <span class="corr" title="miss text">dock</span>
               and watched a lot of women buying fish from a fish <span class="corr" title="miss text">wag</span> Bought
               myself a pair of scissors- and a straw basket to carry my paints in. Back to the <span class="corr" title="spell err">hotell</span> and Gail went swimming<span class="corr" title="miss text">-tempture 66 </span>Then we suddenly decided we might as well get off on the 12.30
               <span class="corr" title="spell err">ferryinstead</span> of waiting <span class="corr" title="miss text">fo</span> the 5 o'clock which would only bring us into <span class="corr" title="miss text">so lat</span> S we hustled around- Otto had let some shirts go to the

               hour. Not many people on board and about eight cars. We rather hated to leave Ulrik.
               The
               hotel Brakanes is said to be the best in Norway.It was warm and lovely- people lying
               <span class="corr" title="spell err">about</span> on the grass-having tea etc. The re is a
               little bath shed with compartment and curtains along the edge of the terrace.All very
               casual
               and quite delighttul The drive was along the edge of the Hardanager Fjoud. The largest
               and
               deepst of them all.Some places were very rocky- the road being blasted out of the
               rock.
               Beautiful waterfalls- some tunnels to pass <span class="corr" title="miss text">thro</span> Arrived <span class="corr" title="spell err">atthe</span> Solfonn Hotel about 4.30 Wrote <span class="corr" title="spell err">lletters</span> and rested, Dinner o fresh salmon
