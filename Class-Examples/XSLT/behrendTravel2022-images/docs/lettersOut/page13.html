            BRAKANES. (BOATS FOR HOTEL GUESTS. SWIMMING. TEMP. 66 At breakfast I
            collected a little assortment of cracker for the trip this P.M.(as one never can be
            sure
            where we eat next on these trips.)We wandered down to the dock
            and watched a lot of women buying fish from a fish wag Bought
            myself a pair of scissors- and a straw basket to carry my paints in. Back to the hotell and Gail went swimming-tempture 66 Then we suddenly decided we might as well get off on the 12.30
            ferryinstead of waiting fo the 5 o'clock which would only bring us into so lat S we hustled around- Otto had let some shirts go to the
            laundry- but the rushed around and finished them. The
            feryy was the "Folgefonn" Very nice vayage of les than an
            hour. Not many people on board and about eight cars. We rather hated to leave Ulrik.
            The
            hotel Brakanes is said to be the best in Norway.It was warm and lovely- people lying
            about on the grass-having tea etc. The re is a
            little bath shed with compartment and curtains along the edge of the terrace.All very
            casual
            and quite delighttul The drive was along the edge of the Hardanager Fjoud. The largest
            and
            deepst of them all.Some places were very rocky- the road being blasted out of the
            rock.
            Beautiful waterfalls- some tunnels to pass thro Arrived atthe Solfonn Hotel about 4.30 Wrote lletters and rested, Dinner o fresh salmon
