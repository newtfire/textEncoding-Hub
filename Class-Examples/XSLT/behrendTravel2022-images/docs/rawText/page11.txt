AUGUST 25th LEAVING STALHEIM FOR ULVICK
Deci ed that, if we could get rooms at Ulvick we woud le ve Stalheim and go on.
As nothing much to do here
except look at the views nd CLIMB about.
Had the usual
heary laden Smorgesbrod-but this time with aohest to goodness electric toaster- so we had TOAST. We strolled around and went into the 'pill box" the Germans had built in a spot overlooking everything. Peeked into the so called museum- three little wooden houses grass roofs. filled with old wooden farm shovels, , buckets etc.It wou ld notbe open until 11 and anyway we have, by now, seen a number of these museums and somemvery fine ones.
Sat on the terrace and talked with Mrs. Maxwell- Mr
Clothier was out for a walk with three sturdy English girl girls.These girls walked 7 miles yesterday
So we departed with a lunch, about noon. Southward.
Huge blue busses were continuely wheeling up to the hotel before we left. Some having met the steamers and others coming over the roads from quite some distance.
Along by the edge of the fjoyd we stopped to fish and to have out lunch. The lunch was HORRIBLE bad meat. I hope we don't catch anything from the one bite.Also no, fish.
But a lovely place near some low water falls. But the little Sunkist oranges were all right
I my pocket I had some crackers snitched_from the
breaffast table'A, 2 o'clock
stopped to photograph the beautiful Twindefoss Falls.
T thi nk Twin Falls'!!F om here 45 kilometres to Ulvick.The distances ar not great but the roads are
narrow and winding- so one drives slowly therefore to go a few miles takes awhile
People in the fields raking up the hay.
They do it three in a row and rake in unison. Smart , Voss, where we turned
South.
Quite a town
Many neat new cement
buildings and some industries.
Snow ploughs
along the road sides all neatly painted- ready for the winter. Smallchildren
on skis		2 to 3 years start to pratice First hey just stand on them then take a few slides etc
S uth from Voss passing a sort of minig project.  WE stopped to ask about it. Slate for the roofs.
