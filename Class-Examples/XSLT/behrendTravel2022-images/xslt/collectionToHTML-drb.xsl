    <!-- 2022-11-28 ebb: This XSLT reads a collection of XML files and outputs **separate HTML files** for each XML file in the collection. 
        **We're working with the 2022 Behrend Travel Letters from Europe project.**
        
        * We'll introduce xsl:for-each here to loop through each file in the collection and output a new file. 
        * We'll block related images with each letter in the output HTML,
        * We'll also experiment with reaching into multiple directories to retrieve image files associated with each letter, 
        based on corellating file names
        * We'll use XPath function base-uri() to retrieve the file name, and then apply string functions to isolate the portion of the filename
        that matches up with the image file name in the docs/images/ directory,
        * We'll continue working with xsl variables to define filepaths to work with to reach into collections, this time of XML and of image files.

     <!--  ebb: Below is an xsl:variable set to store a collection of XML documents (stored in our file directory
    named xml-letters. We need to ignore everything except the XML files in that directory (so XSLT doesn't try to
    process the Relax NG schema), so the ?select="*.xml" selects only the XML files in the collection. -->

    <xsl:variable name="travelColl" as="document-node()+"
        select="collection('../XML-RNG/?select=*.xml')[base-uri()[contains(., 'page')]]"/>
    <!-- Some of the collection files aren't letter pages. There is an imageDesc file in here, too. So I added a predicate to filter only the 
    the ones whose filename contains 'page'. This uses the XPath base-uri() function which retrieves the filename for a document.-->
    
    
    <!-- ebb: Here's one more variable to reach just the team's imgDesc file when we need it. This XML file has coded descriptions of each
    image. -->

       <!-- ebb: NOW we introduce xsl:for-each.
          *  xsl:for-each processes each member of a sequence one at a time.
          *  We commonly use it when xsl:template rules can't match on something: like something that is not a simple XML element node.
          *  You could use xsl:for-each to process each member of a sequence of sorted distinct-values if you like (these are off the XML tree of a document)
          *  We use it here to process files in a folder one at a time, and output a NEW HTML FILE for each XML file in it. 
          * Inside xsl:for-each, and inside xsl:template, the current() function captures the current single thing being processed.

                * The @as attribute provides a datatype for the variable: Is it a kind of node? We should say what it is: 
                    document-node() in this case.
                * You don't technically need the @as attribute, but it is considered a best practice to include a type for your variables.

                 * We'll use the base-uri() function to return its filename as a string
                 * Then we can use the substring-before() and substring-after() functions (or just the substring() function) to isolate exactly the bit of 
                 string we need that matches up with related image files in the project directory.

                We're going to create a lettersOut subfolder in docs. 
                base-uri() outputs a full filepath like this: 
                file:/Users/eeb4/Documents/GitHub/newtfire/textEncoding-Hub/Class-Examples/XSLT/behrendTravel2022-images/XML-RNG/page6.xml
                
                So to get the portion we need to create a new filename, we use tokenize(), break the string on `/`, and select the very last piece.
                Then we cut the xml off the end (I like to use substring-before(., 'xml'). 
                
                The result for page6.xml should be: page6.
                
               We'll create a new file extension with html at the end:
