                  <note>Lisa M. Wilson is Professor in the Department of English and Communication at SUNY Potsdam, where she has taught since 2005. Her areas of interest include transatlantic Romantic and Victorian era literature, particularly women’s  writing and popular forms such as the Gothic novel and the literary ballad. She is also interested in book history and bibliographical studies, particularly in the study of authorship in the long nineteenth century (1780-1900). She has published in <title level="j">European Romantic Review</title>, <title level="j">Romanticism on the Net</title> (now <title level="j">RaVon</title>), <title level="j">Romantic Circles</title>, <title level="j">Romantic Textualities</title>, and elsewhere. She is currently working on a monograph on Romantic-period authorship and literary celebrity. Her work on Digital Mitford thus far includes editing and coding Mitford’s <title level="a">Introduction</title> to her collected <title level="m">Dramatic Works</title> (1854), a critical memoir that recounts the author’s influences and experiences at Covent Garden and Drury Lane in the 1820s and 30s. It also includes researching Mitford’s publication history for the site’s working bibliography, particularly tracking the migration of Mitford’s stories from their first publication to their later reappearances in collections and periodicals. A Founding Editor of Digital Mitford, she and her teams of student research assistants have been at work since 2013 on transcribing, coding, and researching Mitford’s letters from 1819 to the early 1820s and on Mitford’s early poems.

                  <note>In 2014, Toni Hays was a student at UCLA, majoring in English
                     Literature with a particular focus on aestheic theory. She is particularly
                     interested in the application of aesthetic theory to British literature of the
                     late Victorian and Modernist periods. She believes in a holistic approach to
                     literature where one combines an understanding of context and content to inform
                     critical analysis. She is also commited to the provision and accessiblity of
                     scholarly research. She worked on Digital Mitford in 2014.

                     <p>A lifelong friend of <persName ref="#MRM">Mary Russell Mitford</persName>
                        who knew her from their childhood in the 1790s, Harness launched the first
                        major effort to collect and edit Mitford’s letters into a series of volumes,
                        which was completed by his assistant, <persName ref="#Lestrange">Alfred Guy
                           Kingan L’Estrange</persName> a year after Harness’s death, and published
                        as <title ref="#Lestrange_Letters">The Life of Mary Russell Mitford, Related
                           in a Selection from her Letters to her Friends</title>. This collection
                        was originally intended to be six volumes, but was cut back to three by the
                        publishers, to Harness’s distress.</p>
                     <p>Harness and <persName ref="#Byron">Byron</persName> were also friends from
                        their schooling at Harrow, as Byron sympathized with Harness’s experience of
                        a disabled foot, crushed in an accident in early childhood. Byron considered
                        dedicating <bibl>the first two cantos of <title level="m">Childe Harold’s
                           Pilgrimage</title>
                        </bibl> to Harness, but refrained so as not to taint Harness’s reputation as
                        he was taking orders as an Anglican curate. Harness admired and encouraged
                        Mitford’s playwrighting in particular, and she commented that he was one of
                        the few of her friends who thought she should prioritize the drama over
                        prose. When <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">William Macready</persName> was
                        attacked in <bibl corresp="#Stage">an anonymous Blackwood’s Magazine piece
                           in 1825</bibl> for his demands and rudeness to Mitford over revisions to
                        <title ref="#Rienzi">Rienzi</title>, Macready assumed that Harness was
                        the author of the anonymous piece, though in <date when="1839">1839</date>
                        after many years of distance, Harness assured Macready in person that he was
                        not the writer, though he may have shared word of the poor treatment his
                        friend had endured.</p>
                     <p>William Harness was the son of John
                        Harness, M.D. and Sarah Dredge; he was baptized at Whitchurch, Hampshire on
                        April 13, 1790. He received his B.A. in 1812 and his M.A. in 1816 from
                        Christ’s College, Cambridge. He served as curate at Kelmeston, Hampshire
                        (1812) and Dorking (1814-1816). He was preacher at Trinity Chapel, Conduit
                        Street, London and minister and lecturer at St. Anne’s in Soho. He was Boyle
                        lecturer in London (1822) and was curate at Hampstead from 1828 to 1844. In
                        1825, he published an eight-volume edition of Shakespeare, including a
                        biography; his friends would later endow a prize in his name at Cambridge
                        for the study of Shakespearean literature. He also authored numerous essays
                        and reviews, some for the <title ref="#QuarterlyRev_per">Quarterly Review</title>. From 1844 to 1847 he was
                        minister of Brompton Chapel in London. He undertook to raise the funds to
                        build the church of All Saints, Knightsbridge, in the parish of St.
                        Margaret’s Westminster, which opened in 1849, and he then became perpetual curate of
                        that congregation. At the 1851 and 1861 censuses, he lived at 3 Hyde Park
                        Terrace, Westminster St. Margaret, Middlesex, with his sister <persName ref="#Harness_Mary">Mary Harness</persName>
                        and his first cousin <persName>Jemima Harness</persName>, daughter of his uncle William. He died
                        while on a visit to one of his former curates in
                        Battle, Sussex. At the time of his death he living at the same address at 3
                        Hyde Park Terrace; he is buried in Bath.</p>Sources: <bibl>

The movement aimed to achieve six reforms, largely through constitutional methods, including the presentation of petitions to the House of Commons signed by millions of citizens. The reforms included: 1)universal manhood suffrage for those age 21 and above, thus eliminating the property ownership requirement for male voters, 2)vote by secret ballot, thus eliminating the publication of votes 3)elimination of the property requirement for Members of Parliament, 4)payment for service as a Member of Parliament, thus making office-holding financially feasible for those without independent incomes, 5)redrawing constituency boundaries to ensure that each M.P. represented the same number of voters, thereby equalizing constituencies and eliminating so-called rotten boroughs, and 5)annual parliamentary elections, aimed at decreasing the practice of bribing or intimidating voters.</note>

George was the younger son of merchant William Adams (1752-1811), MP for Plympton Erle (1796-1801) and for Totnes (1801-1811), and Mary Chadder. He was the younger brother of William Dacres Adams (1775-1862), who became Private Secretary to two Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom: Pitt the Younger (1804–1806) and the Duke of Portland (1807-1809). William Dacres Adams inherited the estate of Bowden in the parish of Ashprington, near Totnes in Devon, from his father, who had purchased it from the Trist family about 1800; William Dacres Adams allowed George and his family to live there after his own marriage. Bowden House, the Georgian mansion located on the former estate, is currently a grade I listed building. His middle name is variously recorded as Pownoll and Pownall.</note>

The case is very different now; she is still a poker--but a poker of whom every one is afraid. It must be confessed that this silent observation from such an observer is rather formidable. Most writers are good-humoured chatterers--neither very wise nor very witty:—but nine times out of ten (at least in the few that I have known) unaffected and pleasant, and quite removing by their conversation any awe that may have been excited by their works. But a wit, a delineator of character, who does not talk, is terrific indeed!</quote> Source: <bibl corresp="#Lestrange_Letters">L’Estrange</bibl>.</note>

                  <note resp="#lmw #rnes">Bewick is one of the most important practitioners of modern wood engraving. He is the best-known and one of the finest wood engravers employing a technique (which he did not invent) in which hard boxwood is carved on the end-grain using metal-engraver's tools. This technique allows for the creation of finer and more detailed engraved images and also results in an engraving block that is more durable than those carved with the grain. Notable works of literary illustration include editions of <persName ref="#Goldsmith">Oliver Goldsmith</persName>'s <title level="m">The Traveller</title> and <title level="m">The Deserted Village</title>, Thomas Parnell's <title level="m">The Hermit</title>, and William Somervile's <title level="m">The Chase</title>. His major works as a naturalist include <title level="m">A History of British Birds</title> and <title level="m">A General History of Quadrupeds</title>, as well as a series of editions of <title level="m">Aesop's Fables</title>. One of Bewick's specialties was his tail- or tale-pieces, small engraved illustrations used to fill gaps left by page breaks.</note>

                  <note resp="#ncl #lmw">Quaker, abolitionist, radical reformer in politics and religion, and an agricultural experimenter in the cross-breeding of Merino sheep, Birkbeck emigrated to America in 1817 in order to establish a utopian community in the Illinois territory. Author of <title ref="#America_Birkbeck">Notes on a Journey in America</title> and <title ref="#Illinois_Birkbeck">Letters from Illinois</title>. These much-read works, which presented a utopian, anti-clerical, and anti-aristocratic vision of American settlement, were believed to be instrumental in encouraging many disaffected Europeans to emigrate to the American prairies, and set off a pamphlet war about on the topic of American emigration to the so-called English Prairie. (See Eaton, Joseph. The Anglo-American Pamphlet War, 1800-1825. New York:  Palgrave/Macmillan, 2012). He became president of Illinois's first agricultural society, worked against the establishment of slavery in the state, and briefly served as Secretary of State for Illinois. He was acquainted with Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Edward Coles, and Robert Owen, himself the founder of another midwestern utopian community in New Harmony, Indiana.</note>

                  <note resp="#lmw">Best known as the companion and biographer of Samuel Johnson, Boswell travelled extensively in Europe and Great Britain and published accounts of his travels in Corsica and in the Hebrides. Although never prominent in the legal profession, he was trained in Scotland and practiced as an advocate, and later also practiced at the English bar. Boswell represented the Scottish bookseller Alexander Donaldson in the important copyright case, Donaldson v.  Beckett. <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName> compares his skill as a biographer unfavorably to that of <persName ref="#Aubrey_John">Aubrey</persName>, preferring the latter's brevity.

                     This poet fought on the Parliamentary side in the English Civil Wars and is best known for his satirical burlesque poem Hudibras, which was published in parts in the 1660s and 1670s. Transparently informed by Cervantes's novel <title ref="#Don_Quixote_novel">Don Quixote</title>, Hudibras features a bickering knight-and-servingman duo and scourges various kinds of hypocrisy. It won Butler the patronage of Charles II, despite the poet's earlier political activity.</note>

Married in 1815, Lady Byron formally separated from her husband almost a year later, shortly after Ada's birth. She had left her marital household with her child, having endured many of Lord Byron's outbursts, taunts, and (it has been rumored) rape. She encouraged her daughter's mathematical pursuits, engaging the celebrity mathematician Augustus de Morgan to instruct her. Late in life, Lady Byron was befriended by an American visitor, <title level="m">Uncle Tom's Cabin</title> author Harriet Beecher Stowe, who, after Lady Byron's death, defended her separation from her husband in <title level="m">Lady Byron Vindicated</title>, for which Stowe was widely condemned.</note>

He instituted a disastrous policy of <soCalled>personal rule,</soCalled> and in August 1642, declared war on Parliament. After the Parliamentary faction, with its New Model Army, achieved victory, Charles was tried for treason and, declaring himself <q>the martyr of the people,</q> was executed outside the Banqueting House at Whitehall that had been designed by Inigo Jones for James I. A week after his execution, he was quietly buried at Windsor and the monarchy was abolished. Charles I is the apocryphal author of the <title level="m">Eikon Basilike, or Pourctraiture of his Sacred Majesty in his Solitudes and Sufferings</title> (1649), which was probably written substantially by John Gauden.</note>

                     <p>English Republican military leader, politician, and dictator. The effective protagonist of Mitford’s play<title ref="#CharlesI_MRMplay">Charles the First</title>. A descendant of the Tudor politician Thomas Cromwell, raised in the Cambridgeshire Fens and educated at Cambridge University, he became deeply spiritual in the 1620s, identifying as a Puritan. (He never called himself a Roundhead, and resisted others' use of this Royalist slur.) He became an M.P. and, in 1641, attacked what he considered <q>ecclesiastical tyranny and usurpation.</q> During the <rs type="event" ref="#EngCivilWar">Civil Wars</rs>, he commanded Parliamentary forces as Lieutenant-General, second only to Sir Thomas, Lord Fairfax, who served as the Parliamentary army's General. Cromwell quickly overshadowed Fairfax and devised the <orgName ref="#New_Model_Army">New Model Army</orgName> (founded 1645).</p>
                     <p>After the <persName ref="#ChasI">king</persName>'s capture and extradition from the Isle of Wight, Cromwell seemed not committed to the notion of trying and executing the king until the eleventh hour, but ultimately served as a Commissioner at the trial and signed the warrant. In the aftermath of the King's execution, Ireland (which had rebelled in 1641) developed a Royalist resistance, which Cromwell and his son-in-law <persName ref="#Ireton">Henry Ireton</persName> suppressed between 1649 and 1651. This war resulted in genocide which killed (through violence, displacement, or disease) up to one third of the Irish population; the exact number of casualties and the time-extent of the period are still debated by historians. The period came to be called An Mallact Cromail (The Curse of Cromwell). In Commonwealth England, Cromwell chaired the Republic's Council of State, then, 1653 until his death in 1658, served as Lord Protector, essentially converting the Republic to a dictatorship and alienating many former supporters. After Cromwell's death and the abdication of the second Lord Protector, his son Richard Cromwell, the Republican experiment ended with Parliament inviting <persName ref="#ChasII">Charles I's son</persName> to return from exile to be restored as king. Throughout the nineteenth century, Cromwell's reputation was on an upswing. The trend was towards viewing him as a man guided by devout faith in God, a desire to provide for his country, and a desire to purify the Protestantism in his country.</p>

                     <p>An exceptionally well-educated and self-assured early modern woman whose literary achievements are extremely significant. Her works include the first complete English translation of Lucretius's controversial Epicurean poem <title level="m">De Rerum Natura</title> (in ms. only until 2012), the epic poem <title level="m">Order and Disorder</title>, which has been read as a proto-feminist take on Genesis that invites comparison with her contemporary <title ref="#ParadiseLost">John Milton's Paradise Lost</title>, and her <title ref="#Memoirs_of_the_life_of_Colonel_Hutchinson">Memoirs of the Life of Colonel John Hutchinson</title>, a biography of her husband that brings to life the drama of the <rs type="event" ref="#EngCivilWar">Civil Wars</rs> and the idealism of the Puritans, particularly for religious liberty and republican government. This work, published in 1806, is the only Lucy Hutchinson composition that was known as such during <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName>'s lifetime.</p>
                     <p>Born Lucy Apsley, the daughter of Sir Allen Apsley, Lieutenant of the Tower of London. In 1638 she fell mutually in love with and married Sir John Hutchinson. While he fought on the <orgName ref="#Parliamentarians">Parliamentarian side</orgName> in the <rs type="event" ref="#EngCivilWar">English Civil Wars</rs>, she provided material assistance, at one point contriving for her brother-in-law (Hutchinson's brother) to pose as him while the real Colonel Hutchinson escaped arrest by the Royalists. At the <rs type="event" ref="#Restoration">Restoration</rs>, she may have saved his life by forging an apologetic letter that he might have been more reticent to write.</p>
                     <p>As the critic <persName>Devoney Looser</persName> has shown, Lucy Hutchinson became an extremely well-known figure during the nineteenth century, featuring as a heroine in many works of fiction and drama.</p>

She became Queen of France and Navarre when Louis-Auguste ascended the throne of France; they had four children. In 1791, during the French Revolution, her title was changed to Queen of the French. She was guillotined in 1793 for treason against France and was buried in an unmarked grave; her body and that of her husband were exhumed during the Bourbon Restoration and reburied at the Basilica of St. Denis.</note>

See also the Monthly Magazine 12 (1801): 174 obituary for a Joseph Warry, boot and shoemaker of Reading, for 1801, which suggests the possibility that Mr. Warry may be his son who took over the business. Coles also puzzles over the name in one of Mitford's letters. -->Source:

                  <note resp="#lmw">Military commander and political leader. During the French Revolution and Revolutionary Wars, Napoleon rose to prominence as a military leader. He engineered a coup in 1799 that brought him to power as First Consul of France and then as Napoleon I, Emperor of the French (from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815). As Emperor, he led France against a series of European military coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars, building an empire that extended over most of continental Europe until its collapse in 1815. In spring 1814, the Allies captured Paris and forced Napoleon to abdicate, exiling him to the island of Elba and restoring the Bourbons to power. Less than a year later, Napoleon escaped from Elba and retook control of France, only to suffer defeat by the Allies at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. The British then exiled him to the island Saint Helena in the South Atlantic, where he remained until his death in 1821. He is celebrated as one of Europe's greatest military commanders and as the disseminator of the system of laws known as the Napoleonic Code.</note>

                     <p>Charles Fyshe Palmer was the son of

                           Jones</persName>. <rs type="event">He married <persName ref="#Palmer_Mad">Lady Madelina Gordon Sinclair</persName> in <date when="1805">1805</date> at <placeName>Kimbolton Castle in Kimbolton,
                              Herefordshire</placeName>
                        </rs>. They lived at <placeName>Luckley House, Wokingham,
                           Berkshire</placeName> and at <placeName>East Court, Finchampstead,
                           Berkshire</placeName>. Through her siblings, Lady Madelina was connected
                        to several of the most influential aristocratic families in the country, and
                        Charles Fyshe Palmer’s marriage to Lady Madelina thus gained him access to
                        aristocratic houses, including the <orgName ref="#HollandHouse">Holland
                           House</orgName>.</p>
                     <p>A Whig politician, Palmer began running for Parliament elections as the
                        member for <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName>
                        <date notBefore="1816">after 1816</date>, and appears to have served off and
                        on in that role until <date notAfter="1841">1841</date>. He led the
                        Berkshire meetings to protest British government’s handling of <rs type="event" ref="#Peterloo">the Peterloo Massacre</rs> in <date when="1819">1819</date>. <rs type="event">On <date when="1820-03-16">March 16, 1820</date>, Palmer ran for a seat in Parliament against
                           two other candidates. The votes ran: <persName ref="#Monck_JB">John
                              Berkeley Monck</persName> (418 votes), <persName ref="#Palmer_CF">Charles Fyshe Palmer</persName>(399 votes), and <persName ref="#Weyland_John">John Weyland</persName>(395 votes.)</rs> Mitford’s
                        letters around this time indicate she much preferred his opponent <persName ref="#Monck_JB">J. B. Monck</persName>, and she had earlier satirized
                        Palmer in <date when="1818">1818</date> as <quote>vastly
                           like a mop-stick, or, rather, a tall hop-pole, or an extremely long

                     </p>
                     <p>Mitford also mentions Palmer in connection with a legal issue surrounding

                        </rs>. Mitford also mentions the ways that Palmer’s political opponents
                        sometimes undermined his Whig reformist positions by referencing the noble

                     the daughter of Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, and Jane Maxwell, at
                     Gordon Castle, Bellie, Moray, Scotland. Her first husband was Robert Sinclair,
                     7th Baronet Sinclair; they married in 1789 and had one child, John Gordon
                     Sinclair. Her second husband was the Reading Whig politician <persName ref="#Palmer_CF">Charles Fyshe Palmer</persName>. They married in 1805 at
                     Kimbolton Castle in Kimbolton, Herefordshire. They lived at Luckley House,
                     Wokingham, Berkshire and at East Court, Finchampstead, Berkshire. Through her
                     siblings, Lady Madelina was connected to several of the most influential
                     aristocratic families in the country. Her sister Charlotte Gordon became
                     Duchess of Richmond through her marriage to Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of
                     Richmond, 4th Duke of Lennox and 4th Duke of Aubigny. Her sister
                        <persName>Susan Gordon</persName> became Duchess of Manchester through her
                     marriage to <persName>William Montagu, Duke of Manchester</persName>. Her
                     sister <persName>Louise Gordon</persName> became Marchioness Cornwallis through

                     Gordon, and <persName>Lord Alexander Gordon</persName>. <persName ref="#Palmer_CF">Charles Fyshe Palmer</persName>’s marriage to Lady Madelina
                     thus gained him access to aristocratic houses, including the <orgName ref="#HollandHouse">Holland House</orgName>. Lady Madelina’s name is

                     appears to be the more common and standard spellling of the name, as an
                     anglicization of the French Madeline. For more on the Palmers, see note 2 in

                     1843. He consistently gives his birthplace as Three Mile Cross on census

                     given as <q>clerk in holy orders.</q> Since he disappears from English census
                     records after 1861, reappearing in 1891, and gives his son Arthur Harry
                     Edmund’s birthplace as Isipingo, Natal, South Africa (then a British colony),
                     it seems possible that he emigrated to South Africa between those dates, then

                        Morley scholar. He received from Oxford a B.A. (1776), M.A. (1784), B.D.
                        &amp; D.D. (1792). He took orders in the Church of England in 1777. Richard
                        Valpy served as Second Master at Bury School, Bury, Huntindonshire from 1771
                        to 1781, and was also collated to the rectory of Stradishall, Suffolk, in
                        1787. He became the Headmaster at Reading School, Reading, Berkshire, in

                        to his youngest son Francis E. J. Valpy and continued in semi-retirement
                        until his death in 1836. During his tenure as Headmaster of <placeName ref="#Reading_School">Reading Grammar School</placeName> for boys over

                        Latin textbooks, sermons, volumes of poetry, and adaptations of plays such
                        as Shakespeare’s King John and Sheridan’s The Critic. His <bibl>Elements of

                        triennial visitations and the play receipts went to charitable
                        organizations. Valpy enlisted Mitford to write reviews of the productions
                        for the <title ref="#ReadingMer_per">Reading Mercury</title>. In 1803, his

                     Wakefield, which seems likely, cross-checking with the ODNB. Wakefield's mother
                     was the Quaker writer Priscilla Bell Wakefield, though Wakefield himself
                     converted to the Church of England. He published <title level="m">An Essay on Political
                        Economy</title> in 1799, and qualified for the law in 1807. His first wife,
                     <persName>Isabella Mackie</persName>, swindled him of much of his income and
                     nearly bankrupted him, before she fatally poisoned herself in August 1813.
                     Later that year, 11 November 1813, Wakefield married <persName>Elizabeth
                        Kilgour</persName>. He was eventually very successful and much consulted on
                     legal cases.</note>

                     <!-- scw: See William Silver Darter [An Octogenarian], who names Warry of Minster Street, "an active liberal," as the person who was sent to France (41), although he says it was the 1812 election. See also the Monthly Magazine 12 (1801): 174 obituary for a Joseph Warry, boot and shoemaker of Reading, for 1801, which suggests the possibility that Mr. Warry may be his son who took over the business. Coles also puzzles over the name in one of Mitford's letters. --></note>

                  <note resp="#lmw">The Punch and Judy slapstick puppet shows of England had their
                     roots in the 16th-century Italian commedia dell’arte tradition. The figure of
                     Punch derives from the Neapolitan stock character of Pulcinella, whose name was
                     anglicized Punchinello and shortened to Punch. 17th- and 18th-century shows
                     in England were performed with marionettes on fixed stages. By the end of the
                     18th century, shows were performed using glove puppets on mobile puppet booths
                     and found a home on the nineteenth century on the beaches of English seaside
                     resorts and evolved into children’s entertainments in the Victorian era. Mr.
                     Punch is the traditional protagonist of such shows; episodic plots normally
                     involve Punch beating his wife and other characters with his slapstick and
                     end with him defeating even the Devil himself.</note>

                  <note>Historically, a four thousand acre tract of heathland outside London near
                     Hounslow in the county of Middlesex, crossed by major routes between London and
                     the west and southwest of England. In <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName>’s
                     time, the heath was crossed by the Great West Road and the Bath Road and, as it
                     had been in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, was still known as a
                     dangerous spot for unwary travellers who might find themselves robbed by
                     highwaymen or footpads. From at least the English Civil Wars until World War
                     II, the heath has been used as a military staging area and training ground.
                     Today, all that remains of the heath is two hundred acres preserved as
                     parkland.</note>

Domesticated pigeons such as carrier, homing, and racing pigeons are species of the rock dove. In Britain, the <name ref="#wood_pigeon">wood pigeon</name> is hunted as a game bird and domesticated pigeons were also used as food. In the ancient world, doves were associated with goddesses of love, sexuality, and maternity, such as Inanna Ishtar and Aphrodite. Doves carry symbolic significance in both the Old and New Testaments of the Hebrew Bible: in Genesis in the story of Noah and the ark as a symbol of peace and deliverance, in the Song of Songs as a term of endearment, and in Matthew as a symbol of the Holy Spirit. Doves were also acceptable burnt offerings and came to symbolize peace in early Christianity. Later literary and artistic references often draw on this association of white doves with peace, deliverance, and spiritual gifts, and are representations of the rock dove, which is highly variable in color, ranging from white to shades of grey and pale brown.</note>

The males are brightly-colored, with green heads, while the females are drab. Hybridization has bred types in a variety of colors. Pheasants, likely from the Caucasus, were naturalized in Britain by at least 1050 AD, and may have arrived earlier, with the Romans. The ring-necked variety was reintroduced in the 18th century. In the UK, the birds are hunted by traditional driven-shoot methods, employing beaters, and rough-shoot methods; both methods rely on gun dogs to flush and retrieve the birds.</note>

Not to be confused with the American robin, a new World thrush, this bird is sometimes referred to as an <soCalled>English robin</soCalled> in North America. Frequently referenced in British folk tales and popular culture, the bird became associated with the Christmas holiday in the mid-nineteenth century. The bird's name derives from the male forename Robin or Robert, which led to nicknames of <soCalled>Bob</soCalled> and <soCalled>Bobby</soCalled>.

                     thimbleweed, and smell fox, an allusion to the musky smell of the leaves.
                     However, she may also refer to one of the cultivated varieties not native to
                     England, such as the poppy anemone (Anemone coronaria), which is native to the

Cultivated varieties developed from wild trees in Central Asia, and have likely been domesticated for at least four thousand years. Before the invention of refrigeration, the fruit was important for its ability to be dried, to overwinter in cold storage and to produce fermented cider. While the apple appears in many mythological and religious traditions as a mystical or forbidden object, as in the forbidden Edenic fruit in the Old Testament, the term generally referred to any edible or non-native fruit, and did not necessarily indicate fruits of the genus Malus. There are currently more than 7,000 apple cultivars and the University of Reading, in Berkshire, is responsible for the UK national apple database. Mitford mentions at least three varieties: <q>golden rennet</q> or Golden Reinette also known as the <soCalled>English pippin</soCalled>, a golden-yellow apple, streaked red-orange; <q>russetting</q> types, apples whose smooth skin is covered all or in part by rougher brown skin, thought to have more nutty and aromatic flavors than non-russeting types and used in cider making; and a <q>crumpling</q>type; an underdeveloped or deformed apple that shrivels on the tree.</note>

Beech woods are densely canopied with floors suitable only for shade-loving understory plants such as <name type="#bluebell">bluebell</name>s. The bark is smooth and light grey and the tree bears inconspicuous flowers and catkins that develop into husk-enclosed nuts that are bitter but edible. The nuts and bark are high in tannins, used to tan leather, and the trees produce a fine-grained medium-weight wood used for indoor flooring, staircases, and small furniture. It also makes good firewood, as well as wood pulp for papermaking.</note>

Carries fragrant violet-blue tubular flowers on a one-sided stem. In Britain, it is found in ancient woodlands, where it forms carpets of flowers in the spring, called <soCalled>bluebell woods</soCalled>. Mitford uses the terms <q>wild hyacinth</q> as well as <q>bluebell</q> for this plant. She uses the term <name ref="#harebell">harebell</name> to refer to the more papery bell-flowered campanulas. In a letter to <persName ref="#Hoare_MA">Mrs. Hoare</persName>, Mitford explains the different terms: <q>The Wild Hyacinth, my dear Mrs. Hoare, differs much from the flower which we call the harebell in England: a small campanula, bearing two or three exquisite, thin, bell-like papery flowers (you can hear them rustle when shaken) on a very thin and fragile stalk, growing among wild thyme, and under heather, in the month of August. There is a white variety cultivated in gardens, but no pink one. I have heard both the harebell and the wild hyacinth called blue-bells</q>.</note>

The first printed illustration appeared in the <title level="s">Curtis's Botanical Magazine</title> in 1804 and dahlias became fashionable garden flowers in England by the 1820s. In Mitford's time, both single- and double-flowered varieties were propagated, and varieties were largely classified by flower color. Outside their native range, dahlia tubers are susceptible to frost, and must have their tubers dug over winter and replanted, if they are not grown in greenhouses. Mitford raised and hybridized dahlias.</note>

                  <note resp="#tfb #lmw">The so-called <soCalled>English elm</soCalled> is a deciduous tree with serrated leaves, a variety of the European <soCalled>field elm</soCalled>, introduced into England from Spain in the 16th century. Before Dutch elm disease decimated the population in the 20th century, mature elm trees were a prominent feature of mixed deciduous forests and were also frequently used in landscape gardening. In England, elms were found in mixed forests with oak and ash, often near rivers. While populations still exist, they do not grow to mature size, and so immature elms are today mainly found in hedgerows. Because of its resistance to rot, elm was frequently used to construct medieval water pipes as well as piers, jetties, and lock gates. Because of its resistance to splitting, it was also used to make chair seats, coffins, wagon wheel hubs, and bows. During the enclosure movement, elms were plants in hawthorn hedges, and avenues and groves of elms were popular features of 18th- and 19th-century landscape gardening. Wych elm, also called witch hazel or Scots elm, is also native to the UK. Ancient Roman literature spoke of a <soCalled>marriage</soCalled> between the elm and the vine, in which the elm represented the husband and the vine the wife, because of the Roman practice of planting elms in vineyards to support grape vines; in British literature, this motif appears most frequently as elm and ivy. The ancient Greek tradition of planting elms on graves has also given rise to a <soCalled>elm-and-death</soCalled> motif. They are also frequently mentioned in classical pastoral poetry, where their cool shade is praised as paradisal.</note>

                  <note resp="#lmw">Perennial flowering plant in the Campanula or bellflower family, native across a wide range in the Northern hemisphere, including the UK. Prefers shady woodlands and carries papery violet-blue bell-shaped flowers on a thin stems above slender leaves. Flowers may also be pink or white. Mitford uses the term <name ref="#harebell">harebell</name> for this plant, and uses the terms <q>wild hyacinth</q> and <q>bluebell</q> for the member of the Hyacinch family. In a letter to <persName ref="#Hoare_MA">Mrs. Hoare</persName>, Mitford explains the different terms: <q>The Wild Hyacinth, my dear Mrs. Hoare, differs much from the flower which we call the harebell in England: a small campanula, bearing two or three exquisite, thin, bell-like papery flowers (you can hear them rustle when shaken) on a very thin and fragile stalk, growing among wild thyme, and under heather, in the month of August. There is a white variety cultivated in gardens, but no pink one. I have heard both the harebell and the wild hyacinth called blue-bells</q>. In the UK, the harbell may flower from July to November. Mitford also uses the term <name ref="#campanula">campanula</name>, which may be used for any member of the bellflower family, but Mitford may use to refer to <soCalled>Canterbury bells</soCalled> (Campanula medium), a taller bellflower than the harebell, native to southern Europe but cultivated as a garden plant in Britain.</note>

Hazelnuts are round and the kernel edible and may be eaten fresh or dried. Mitford employs the term <q>cobnut</q> and distinguishes it from the <q>filberd</q>. The shrubby trees form an important component of hedgerows, particularly in the English lowlands. The trees may also be managed by coppicing, a practice that produces the thin, curved poles traditionally used in making withy and wattle fencing, in wattle-and-daub building, and in framing coracle boats.</note>

                  <note resp="#lmw">Large, deciduous fruit-bearing tree, native to a small area of southeastern Europe and cultivated in gardens and parks throughout many parts of Europe and North America. The tree bears showy white flower spikes in the spring and develops spiky green fruits that contain a large tan and brown seed or nut, called a conker or horse-chestnut. They are members of the soapberry and lychee family and unrelated to other chestnut trees, which are members of the beech family.  In the UK, children collect the nuts for a game called conkers. Mitford particularly mentions the trees when in flower in the spring.

It carries inconspicuous yellow-green flower clusters that develop into orange or purple-black berries. In floriography, ivy represents married love and fidelity. Associated with Bacchus and also used as a tavern sign indicating that wine is sold. Ancient Roman literature spoke of a <soCalled>marriage</soCalled> between the elm and the vine, in which the elm represented the husband and the vine the wife, because of their practice of planting elms in vineyards to support the vines; in British literature, this motif appears most frequently as elm (or oak) and ivy. <title level="a">The Holly and the Ivy</title> is a traditional English folk song that dates from the early nineteenth century, or earlier. The plants have been used as British Advent and Christmas decorations since at least the 15th century, and feature in other traditional holiday carols, as well.</note>

                  <note resp="#lmw #slc">Mitford likely refers to the common or English oak (Quercus robur), a variety of white oak, although the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) is also native to the Europe and the UK. Large, long-lived deciduous hardwood tree with lobed leaves, hanging catkins in spring, and then acorns, oval nuts with woody caps. In 19th-century English forests, oak was the predominant deciduous tree, often found with <name ref="#ash">ash</name> and <name ref="#elm">elm</name>. A hard wood with a distinctive light-and-dark grain, used since the early medieval period for making sturdy furniture, flooring, doors, household items such as chests and buckets, and for building sailing ships, particularly large naval vessels. Because the tree is large, strong and long-lived, it has accumulated numerous symbolic and national associations, particularly in the UK. In English folklore, Robin Hood hid in an oak to escape pursuers, and the oak became a national symbol after the future <persName ref="#ChasII">Charles II</persName> reportedly hid in an oak during the <rs type="event" ref="#EngCivilWar">English Civil Wars</rs>. This tree became known as the <soCalled>Royal Oak</soCalled>, and led to a national celebration of <soCalled>Oak Apple Day</soCalled> in May. <q>Royal Oak</q> became a popular pub name, as well as the name of several Royal Navy warships. The symbolic association between Britain's military strength and the strength of its men is encapsulated in the song <title level="a">Heart of Oak</title>, written in 1759 and revised in 1809: <quote>Heart of oak are our ships,/Hearts of oak are our men</quote>. Oak leaves, like laurel, were used as ceremonial wreaths and crowns, and both oak leaves and acorns appeared as neoclassical ornaments. The proverb <q>great oaks from little acorns grow</q>, dates from at least the 16th century, and the concept appears in Chaucer's <title level="m">Troilus and Criseyde</title>.

That means that I have no idea what happens in 1819, if series one ceases publication in December 1818, as sources indicate. Sometimes the numbering can be off from the actual month/year that the issue was published, and this may have led to the bibliographic confusion of dates. We'd have to check the microfilm versions and their title pages to be sure.--><!--scw: earliest we have in our collection in Box is Sept 1822. I'll see if I can IL some microfilm from my end. I've been able to in the past.--></note>

Inspired by a manuscript translated from the Italian by Mary Shelley (who also claimed to have discussed with her husband the play's scene breakdown), The Cenci tells a powerful story of political tyranny, incestuous rape, and violent, quickly-suppressed revolt. The play's depiction of rape, incest, and parricide was the apparent cause of its rejection by the Theatre at Covent Garden. It was not produced until 1886, when it premiered in an unlicensed London performance organized by the actor Alma Murray, who played Beatrice.</note>

                  <!--SCW: More research may be needed on the reprint history of the Christmas Amusements series. They are essentially charades and dramatics. Edinburgh Tales is an anthology of Tait's Edinburgh Magazine publications, which had been Johnstone's Edinburgh Magazine prior to June 1834, and based on the repub of CA in Edinburgh Tales, my sense it that CA were published there first. I wasn't able to find copies of then online to verify and date.-->

                     added a second section on fly-fishing. Mitford was likley familiar with the

                     each (some listing ’White’ as the name of the publisher, although this may be a

                     partial quarto editions of the middle 40 cantos (possibly gathered from
                     individual cantos, as each were numbered separately); and a 12mo. complete

                  <note resp="#rnes #lmw">Three-act historical drama collaboratively written by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey. At the time of the play's writing, it was printed by radical Benjamin Flower but never performed. The play, drafted soon after Robespierre's death, presents a complex portrait of Maximilien Robespierre, political architect (and eventual victim) of the Reign of Terror that followed the French Revolution. This play proved an embarrassment to Southey after his repudiation of his youthful radicalism.</note>

                     in 1819. In his preface, Fearon claims to be an unbiased observer and reporter

                        settlement. I have had every motive to speak what I thought the truth, and
                        none to conceal or pervert it.</quote> The volume is dedicated to <q>The

                     printing themselves and printed only 50 copies, because the bankrupt Duke could
                     not finance the venture. In her February 27, 1819 letter to Elford, Mitford
                     indicates that she does not expect him to buy a copy, since he is <q>a great deal
                     too wise to deal in books printed upon drawing paper in Atlas quarto--books
                     merely meant to make a show.</q> It is unknown how many copies were sold.</note>
