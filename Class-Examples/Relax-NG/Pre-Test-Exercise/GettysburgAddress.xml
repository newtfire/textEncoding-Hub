                Later on, we'll learn how to write code that automatically generates numbering attributes (n="1", n="2", n="3", etc) so you never have to do this by hand. We wanted to make this an illustration of how a schema can help you catch a coding error. 
                We actually want to see errors like this being marked and called out by Relax NG in a real project.
                On the Relax NG test, by the time you reach this point, you can expect that the XML will be valid against the schema.
