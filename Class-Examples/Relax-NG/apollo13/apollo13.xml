                        like you to enable quads C and D. For the maneuver, use all your quads. And
                        in precisely 1 minute, we'd like you to terminate the battery charge on
                        battery B. One other request, we'd like to have you verify -

                        yaw, that the signal strength would just drop off and yaw would go to zero
