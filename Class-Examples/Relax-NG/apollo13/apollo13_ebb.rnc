# ebb: This is a Relax NG comment. 
start = apollo13
# start is a reserve word for the beginning of a schema. 

apollo13 = element apollo13 {doc, head, body}
# A schema line always takes the form: label = type name {content}
# The comma , is a sequence indicator: the elements above must appear in this order.
# The elements have no repetition indicators, so they are only allowed to appear once. 

doc = element doc {source, type, empty}
# empty is a reserve word, indicating this element is self-closing and contains nothing between tags.
# The only things defined on this empty element are two attributes.

source = attribute source {"nasa" | "rsa" | "esa"}
type = attribute type {"techtranscript"}
# This is how you define specific legal attribute values: Remember the quotation marks. 
# The pipe character: | goes in between the values to indicate "or": "nasa" or "rsa" or "esa" may be used as a value.

head = element head {crew, groundControl}
body = element body {  (transmission | O2-tank-anomaly)*, closing }
closing = element closing {text}
O2-tank-anomaly = element O2-tank-anomaly {empty}
# repetition indicators: 
# ? zero or 1
# + 1 or more
# * zero or more

crew = element crew {person+}
groundControl = element groundControl {person+}
person = element person {role, text}
# role is an attribute. Since XML only allows a particular attribute to appear once, the only repetition indicator that makes sense
# for an attribute in a content model is the ? (zero or one). IF the attribute is optional on an element, it will take a ?

role = attribute role {xsd:ID}
# xsd:ID is a special datatype for a distinct identifier. It means that whatever the value of this attribute, it may only be used once.

transmission = element transmission {MET, com, mixed{(panel | MCandW)* }}
# mixed{} content is special: This is when elements contain a mixture of text and other elements,
# or what we call "element soup": elements floating in text.
# If the elements can appear in ANY order, we use the "or" pipe: | between them. 
# Parentheses set up a grouping. When the computer evaluates the rule above, it checks every element in the tag soup, 
# to see whether it is either a panel or an MCandW. That combination: (panel | MCandW)* may apear ZERO or MORE times.
# That is the most flexible definition. 
# IF we used the comma sequence indicator and no parentheses, like this: mixed{panel*, MCandW*}, we would be calling for 
# zero or more panel elements **followed by** zero or more MCandW elements.

# Attributes are not really part of mixed{} content. We set them up first, and then move on to define what's inside the tags as the 
# mixed{} content. 

MET = attribute MET {xsd:duration} #xsd:duration is a standard datatype for an indication of length of time. 
com = attribute com {xsd:IDREF} #xsd:IDREF is a special datatype that must be the value of an xsd:ID. It may appear multiple times, 
# but must be the value of an xsd:ID defined elsewhere in the document.

panel = element panel {text}
MCandW = element MCandW {text}
# text is a reserve word. Notice it comes up in blue as its own color.
# If you define an element named <text>, you need to give it something else for a label.
# like this:
# textElement = element text {content}
