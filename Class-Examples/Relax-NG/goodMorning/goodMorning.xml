<!-- First, write your Relax NG schema in its own file in Compact Syntax to try to validate this XML code, the content models 
    for its elements and attributes. Write and save your file as .rnc (Relax NG Compact Syntax), 
    and save it in a folder together with this XML file. 
    
    Now, in oXygen, with this XML file open, go to Document >> Schema >> Associate Schema to associate
the schema. Browse to find it, and mark the checkbox indicating 
"Use path relative to file location". oXygen will then create the schema line for you, and the schema 
will be operational on the file! 

Expect to see errors being flagged
in your XML: these will be schema validation errors for anything
that your model didn't take into account. Either change your XML to match your schema,
or fix the schema so it properly defines your XML structure. 
The goal? A green square in oXygen!
