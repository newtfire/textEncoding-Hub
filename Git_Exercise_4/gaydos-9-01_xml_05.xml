    <heading>BALLAD OF BOOKER T.
    by
    Langston Hughes</heading>
<line n="1">Booker T.</line>
<line n="2">Was a practical man.</line>
<line n="3">He said, Till the soil</line>
<line n="4">And learn from the land.</line>
<line n="5">Let down your bucket</line>
<line n="6">Where you are.</line>
<line n="7">Your fate is here</line>
<line n="8">And not afar.</line>
<message lines="5 to 8" meaning="he seems to be advising people to stop looking ahead for their fate and instead make of themselves that which they desire"/>
<repetition lines="5 to 8" times="1"/>
<line n="9">To help yourself</line>
<line n="10">And your fellow man,</line>
<line n="11">Train your head,</line>
<line n="12">Your heart, and your hand.</line>
<message lines="9 to 12" meaning="for slaves to fight against the injustices against them, they must help each other"/>
<line n="13">For smartness alone's</line>
<line n="14">Surely not meet—</line>
<line n="15">If you haven't at the same time</line>
<line n="16">Got something to eat.</line>
<line n="17">Thus at Tuskegee</line>
<line n="18">He built a school</line>
<line n="19">With book-learning there</line>
<line n="20">And the workman's tool.</line>
<line n="21">He started out</line>
<line n="22">In a simple way—</line>
<line n="23">For yesterday</line>
<line n="24">Was not today.</line>
<line n="25">Sometimes he had</line>
<line n="26">Compromise in his talk—</line>
<line n="27">For a man must crawl</line>
<line n="28">Before he can walk—</line>
<line n="29"><history Alabama="slavery"/>And in Alabama in '85</line>
<line n="30">A joker was lucky</line>
<line n="31">To be alive.</line>
<line n="32">But Booker T.</line>
<line n="33">Was nobody's fool:</line>
<line n="34">You may carve a dream</line>
<line n="35">With an humble tool.</line>
<line n="36">The tallest tower</line>
<line n="37">Can tumble down</line>
<line n="38">If it be not rooted</line>
<line n="39">In solid ground.</line>
<line n="40">So, being a far-seeing</line>
<line n="41">Practical man,</line>
<line n="42">He said, Train your head,</line>
<line n="43">Your heart, and your hand.</line>
<line n="44">Your fate is here</line>
<line n="45">And not afar,</line>
<line n="46">So let down your bucket</line>
<line n="47">Where you are.</line>

<!--I would've liked to use the web archive to help with this assignment but it wouldn't load on my computer. oops.-->
<!--I initially thought I could use self-closing elements to mark the lines and normal element tags to mark other things of note, but I don't like how self-closing elements don't cause a line break when pretty-printed. Though, man, is it tedious to mark every line with "line".-->
