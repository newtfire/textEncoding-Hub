<Header>BALLAD OF BOOKER T. by  Langston Hughes </Header>

<highlight category="subject">Booker T.
    <!-- lph- "Born a slave in Virginia in 1856, Washington was the founder of the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama in 1881." (Library of Virginia) --></highlight> 
Was a practical man.  
He said, Till the soil  
And learn from the land. 
<stamped>Let down your bucket  
Where you are.  
Your fate is here  
And not afar. 
To help yourself  
And your fellow man,
    <!-- lph- Has official stmap from the Library of Congress--> </stamped> 
Train your head,  
Your heart, <highlight category="underlined">and your hand.</highlight> 
For smartness alone's  
Surely not meet—  
If you haven't at the same time  
Got something to eat. 
Thus at Tuskegee  
He built a school  
With book-learning there  
And the workman's tool. 
He started out  
In a simple way—  
For yesterday  
Was not today. 
Sometimes he had  
<highlight category="note">Compromise in his talk— <!-- lph- This reminds me of Du Bois calling Washington's speech the "Atlanta Compromise." --></highlight>  
For a man must crawl  
Before he can walk— 
And in Alabama in '85  
A joker was lucky  
To be alive. 
But Booker T.  
Was nobody's fool:  
You may carve a dream  
With an humble tool. 
The tallest tower  
Can tumble down  
If it be not rooted  
In solid ground. 
So, being a far-seeing  
Practical man,
He said, Train your head,
Your heart, and your hand.
Your fate is here
And not afar,
<highlight category="quote">So let down your bucket
Where you are
<!-- lph- origins ar from Washington's famous speech in 1895 that was in Atlanta, Georgia, at the Cotton States and International Exposition. --></highlight>.
