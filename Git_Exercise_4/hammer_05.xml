                <note>- Langston Hughes (1902-1967), known for his lyric poetry, often wrote
                    insightful commentaries about African-American culture and race relations in the
                    United States. In this 1941 poem he makes a case for the vindication of educator
                    Booker T. Washington (1856-1915), the former slave and founder of Tuskegee
                    Institute (1881) and the National Negro Business League (1900) who was harshly
                    criticized by many people for emphasizing vocational education as the
                    prerequisite for the political empowerment of black people. In his poem, Hughes
                    stresses the fact that Washington wanted to train the head, the heart, and the
                    hand. He focuses on Washington's practicality and explains the educator's
                    strategy with the statement, "Sometimes he had / compromise in his talk-- / for
                    a man must crawl / before he can walk / and in Alabama in '85 / a joker was
                    lucky / to be alive."</note>
                <note>- Because the Library holds several dated drafts of the "Ballad of Booker T.,"
                    as well as the signed, finished version, researchers can learn how Hughes
                    crafted his words so that the rhythm and the rhyme were syncopated, smooth, and
                    flowing.</note>

                <l>To help yourself</l>
                <l>And your fellow man,</l>
                <l>Train your head,</l>
                <l>Your heart, <special type="underline">and your hand</special>.</l>

                <l>Got something to eat.</l>
                <l>Thus at Tuskegee</l>
                <l>He built a school</l>
                <l>With book-learning there</l>
                <l>And the workman's tool.</l>
                <l>He started out</l>
                <l>In a simple way—</l>
                <l>For yesterday</l>
                <l>Was <special type="underline">not</special> today.</l>
                <l>Sometimes he had</l>
                <l>Compromise in his talk—</l>
                <l>For a man must crawl</l>
                <l>Before he can walk—</l>
                <l>And in Alabama in '85</l>
                <l>A joker was lucky</l>
                <l>To be alive.</l>
                <l>But Booker T.</l>
                <l>Was nobody's fool:</l>
                <l>You may carve a dream</l>
                <l>With an humble tool.</l>
                <l>The tallest tower</l>
                <l>Can tumble down</l>
                <l>If it be not rooted</l>
                <l>In solid ground.</l>
                <l>So, being a far-seeing</l>
                <l>Practical man,</l>
                <l>He said, Train your head,</l>
